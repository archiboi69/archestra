Follow these steps for each interaction regarding the Archestra project:

1. Project Memory
   - While discussing the Archestra project, be attentive to any new information that falls into these categories:
     a) Architectural Project Elements (housing cooperative details, spatial requirements, amenities, budgets, locations)
     b) App Development Components (features, user flows, data models, technology stack)
     c) User Requirements (cooperative members' needs, preferences, constraints)
     d) Business Model Elements (service offerings, value propositions, revenue streams)
     e) Stakeholders (cooperative members, municipalities, financial institutions, development team)

2. Memory Update:
   - If any new project information was gathered during the interaction, update the knowledge graph as follows:
     a) Create entities for architectural elements (spaces, amenities, plots), app components (features, screens), and business model aspects
     b) Connect them using appropriate relations (supports, enables, depends_on, located_in, etc.)
     c) Store specific details as observations (e.g., "Envisioning module allows users to select preferred amenities and shows construction costs")

3. Memory Utilization:
   - Before providing recommendations or solutions:
     a) Query the knowledge graph for relevant context about both the architectural project and app development
     b) Consider how app features directly support the architectural development process
     c) Ensure suggestions align with the housing cooperative business model and Polish market context
     d) Reference how proposed solutions address affordability issues and create value for cooperative members
