A Computational Framework for Urban Family Housing in Poland

# Abstract
Poland's housing market exhibits a structural mismatch between supply and demand, particularly for families seeking larger apartments in urban locations. The market is dominated by developer-built investment-oriented smaller units in cities and individual self-build houses in suburban areas, forcing families to either compromise on space or relocate to suburbs, fundamentally altering their lifestyle preferences. This thesis examines collective self-development (CSD) as a potential alternative that addresses this gap in housing provision. Through analysis of established German *baugruppen* model and pioneering Polish initiatives, the research identifies three key requirements for successful implementation: developing a procedural framework, strategic market positioning, and rebranding traditional cooperativism to overcome local cultural barriers.

The project demonstrates a comprehensive four-stage implementation process (Interest, Planning, Building, and Owner Communities) to develop a multi-family residence on an urban infill site in Poznań, Poland. It utilizes a computational design workflow that allows the development to mediate between 9-15 households' specific needs while integrating shared amenities that would be unaffordable individually. The design achieves a 20-30% cost advantage over comparable developer-built housing while maintaining high-quality and creating spaces that foster community interaction.

By addressing procedural complexity, land acquisition challenges, and the tension between economic and social considerations, this thesis establishes collective self-development as a viable "third way" between developer-built and self-build housing. The implementation model provides a template that can be adapted across Poland's urban centers, enabling families to remain in cities while accessing appropriately sized housing that meets their spatial needs, lifestyle preferences, and financial constraints.

## Housing affordability crisis

Rising living costs represent the primary concern for residents across developed nations (Ipsos, 2025). In Europe, housing affordability emerged as a particularly critical challenge as the housing market has experienced price growth that significantly outpaces general inflation. Between 2015 and 2023, residential property prices increased by an average of 48% across the European Union, whereas in Poland by 79.8% (Eurostat, 2023). The political importance of this issue is evident in voting patterns, as housing affordability became the leading motivation for voter participation in the 2024 European elections (Eurobarometer, 2024).

This exceptional price growth results from multiple factors affecting both market supply and demand. On the supply side, construction activity faces limitations from increasing building material costs and persistent labor shortages. On the demand side, the housing market has transformed as properties increasingly serve as investment vehicles rather than primarily as homes. High interest rates have further complicated this situation by raising financing costs for middle-income buyers seeking to purchase homes (Eurostat, 2023).

Poland presents a particularly instructive case of these affordability challenges. Research by the European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion (ESPON) has identified a distinctive pattern in Poland's housing market. While most European countries show right-skewed housing price distributions—meaning more lower-priced housing—Poland exhibits an approximately normal distribution (ESPON, 2024). This pattern, when considered alongside Poland's income distribution (where median income falls substantially below average income), reveals a structural mismatch between housing supply and affordability needs (Statistics Poland, 2024).

The affordability problem becomes most severe for families seeking appropriately sized housing. When examining the financial requirements for a 100m² unit—a size typically needed by families—Poland ranks among the European Union's least accessible housing markets. Many regions require more than one person's complete income for renting such units or demand over 35 years of dedicating 40% of annual income for purchase (ESPON, 2024). Lack of adequate housing is shown as a major factor in driving suburbanization as young families leave the cities for cheaper suburbs.

## Structure of housing supply

The ability of a family to find adequate housing is directly tied to housing supply. Poland's construction sector has achieved remarkable output levels. Between 2016 and 2021, the sector delivered more new dwellings than the entire housing stock of Warsaw (Lis et al. 2023). However, this impressive quantity masks a concerning lack of diversity in housing delivery methods. The market is highly concentrated, with real estate developers and individual investors accounting for nearly all new housing stock. In 2024, of 199,931 new housing units, 62% came from developers, 35% from individual investors, and only 3% from housing cooperatives and other non-market actors (Statistics Poland, 2025).

This market structure presents prospective homeowners with a binary choice: developer-built units or self-build single-family houses. These options represent fundamentally different approaches to housing development, each with distinct characteristics and trade-offs.

Developer-built housing dominates the multi-family sector. Real estate developers manage the entire development process from land acquisition through construction to sales, focusing on risk management, feasibility analysis, and market alignment (Graaskamp, 1992). Operating as risk-minimizing enterprises, they prioritize standardized designs and mainstream market segments, typically delivering either multi-family buildings with investor-friendly smaller units or standardized single-family houses (BBSR, 2009).

The developer model offers several advantages, particularly in terms of scale and efficiency as these firms undertake large-scale projects to offset fixed costs. While buyers are provided with a hands-off experience and regulatory protections, this convenience comes at a cost as developer-built housing includes 20-30% profit margins (National Bank of Poland, 2024). Moreover, to minimize risk, developers operate almost exclusively in high-demand urban areas with appropriate zoning and naturally prioritize short-term returns over long-term operating costs.

At the other end of the spectrum is individual self-build housing. Individual investors directly manage their development, typically building single-family houses or duplexes in rural or suburban locations. While self-builders assume full financial and project management risk, they gain complete control over design and customization. This approach eliminates developer margins but requires significant personal involvement and expertise in construction management.

This stark contrast in development approaches has created pronounced market segmentation. Developers dominate urban areas with large-scale, standardized projects, while individual self-builders operate primarily in rural or suburban locations with available smaller plots.

## Collective self-development as an alternative

One promising approach to bridging this market gap is collaborative housing, an umbrella term encompassing various forms of resident-led development. While diverse forms of collaborative housing have gained traction across Europe, implementing such models in Poland requires careful consideration of the local context. Research indicates that collaborative housing faces several cultural and practical barriers in Poland. Young Poles strongly prioritize individual homeownership, viewing it as a marker of life success, and generally resist shared living arrangements. For those more inclined to sharing resources, financial savings emerge as the primary motivation, while concerns about lengthy development processes, limited space, and shared ownership structures act as significant deterrents (Lis et al., 2023).

Given these cultural preferences and constraints, this thesis focuses specifically on collective self-development as the most promising collaborative housing model for the Polish market. At its core, collective self-development involves coordination between future residents and other stakeholders throughout the development process, with residents actively participating in planning, design, and sometimes construction while maintaining individual autonomy in their living spaces (Czischke et al., 2021). This approach aligns with local preferences while leveraging the benefits of group coordination.

The following table illustrates how collective self-development positions itself as a "third way" between traditional developer-built and individual self-build housing:

| Characteristic | Developer-built Housing | Collective Self-development | Self-build Housing |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Scale | Large developments | Medium-sized projects (10-20 units) | Single units or duplexes |
| Location | Urban and suburban areas with existing zoning | Urban and semi-urban areas with municipal support | Rural and suburban areas, including agricultural land |
| Project Risk | Assumed by developer; buyer protected by regulations | Shared among group members; partially mitigated by collective approach | Fully assumed by the owner-builder |
| Economies of Scale | Significant cost advantages in materials and labor | Moderate economies of scale through collective purchasing | None; each project unique |
| Customization | Limited; standardized designs | Balanced; individual units within collective framework | Full customization possible |
| Buyer Involvement | Minimal; turnkey solution | Moderate to high; shared decision-making process | Extensive; manages entire process |
| Cost Structure | Includes 20-30% developer margin | No developer margin; shared overhead costs | No developer margin; direct costs only |
| Time Horizon | Short-term focus; limited post-sale involvement | Medium to long-term; emphasis on community building | Long-term perspective on maintenance and operations |
| Target Market | Investment-oriented buyers, first-time homeowners seeking convenience | Urban middle-class families seeking affordability and community | Families seeking customization and cost control |

The affordability crisis and structural market gaps identified earlier create a compelling need to examine collective self-development in depth. With housing prices outpacing incomes by significant margins and current market options failing to serve middle-income families adequately, alternative approaches that can deliver quality housing at lower costs become essential. As collective self-development models have already demonstrated promising results in other European contexts, particularly Germany, and have begun to emerge in Poland, a systematic examination of these models offers valuable insights into addressing Poland's specific housing challenges. By understanding both mature implementations and early Polish initiatives, we can identify adaptable strategies for scaling this approach as a viable "third way" in Poland's housing landscape.

# State of the art

Collective self-development represents a significant innovation in housing delivery systems that has emerged across various global contexts (Palmer, 2020; Barenstein & Pfister, 2019). To better understand the potential and challenges of implementing it in Polish context, we can examine the mature German *Baugruppen* model alongside pioneering Polish initiatives.

## German Baugruppen model

Germany's *Baugruppen* (building groups) model stands as a particularly instructive case study that has evolved from experimental beginnings to achieve substantial market presence. *Baugruppen* are groups of people that participate in the planning, design, and sometimes construction of multi-unit housing projects while maintaining individual ownership of their units. The model adapts Germany's earlier *Genossenschaften* (cooperative) tradition for contemporary contexts. Beginning as isolated projects among friend networks in the 1970s, *Baugruppen* gained momentum in the mid-1990s through systematic implementation in Tübingen and Freiburg's urban redevelopment areas. This evolution from marginal experiment to established practice has resulted in the model now accounting for approximately 15-17% of new housing production in Germany, demonstrating its viability at meaningful scale (Tummers, 2015; BBSR, 2009).

The *Baugruppen* approach addresses three fundamental housing policy challenges through its distinctive development methodology. First, it achieves affordability improvements through the elimination of developer profit margins and the leveraging of collective negotiation power for procurement. Second, the model fosters social cohesion by establishing neighborhood bonds during the early planning phase. These connections frequently evolve into enduring support networks that enhance residential satisfaction. Third, it enables housing quality by facilitating direct collaboration between residents and architects, thereby prioritizing sustainable materials and ecological considerations that are frequently subordinated in profit-oriented development (BBSR, 2009).

*Baugruppen* initiatives are often supported by German municipalities, which have developed institutional frameworks to facilitate the development process. Cities such as Freiburg, Berlin, Tübingen, and Hamburg have implemented comprehensive programs that combine direct promotion, public-private partnerships, and targeted incentives (Hamiduddin & Gallent, 2016). These typically encompass land allocation, several-month reservation periods with performance-based extensions; infrastructure support through meeting spaces and dedicated municipal contact persons; and public engagement through coordinated information campaigns (Droste, 2015).

The efficacy of the *Baugruppen* model derives substantially from professional facilitation and procedural clarity. With expert architectural and supervisory support, projects typically progress from initial meeting to construction commencement in 6-9 months, contrasting sharply with the 5-7 year timeline often experienced without professional guidance. This efficiency stems from a clearly articulated four-phase development process:

1. The Interest Community phase concentrates on group formation and site selection
2. The Planning Community phase establishes a civil law partnership and develops detailed architectural plans
3. The Building Community phase manages construction execution and project accounting
4. The Owner Community phase transitions the group into a legal community under the german law (BBSR, 2009)

Empirical research demonstrates that *Baugruppen* projects consistently deliver several advantages over conventional development approaches. The model facilitates stronger neighborly relationships while providing customized architectural solutions that reflect specific household requirements (Droste, 2015). Significantly, building groups often succeed in challenging locations rejected by traditional developers, creating high-quality developments in previously undervalued areas. Their projects demonstrate stronger orientation toward demand satisfaction and quality optimization than developer-led initiatives, thereby contributing to sustainable housing markets through long-term resident commitment and community-based initiatives (BBSR, 2009).

Nevertheless, the german model presents notable challenges. Practical difficulties include construction delays, financial uncertainties, and cost escalations resulting from member turnover. The mutual dependence between group members can lead to demanding deliberative processes and extended decision-making timelines (Seeman, 2019). Moreover, while collective self-development effectively serves middle-class households, its capacity to accommodate economically disadvantaged groups remains limited due to the required financial commitments and substantial personal involvement in the development process (Droste, 2015).

To showcase how these advantages and challenges manifest in practice, we can examine two contrasting *Baugruppen* projects that illustrate different approaches to implementation:

### Building Community "Südlicht" in Berlin-Pankow

The Südlicht project in Berlin-Pankow exemplifies the *Baugruppen* model's adaptation to established urban contexts. Initiated in 2006, the project serves as a pioneering development in the Eschengraben area, subsequently inspiring several neighboring *Baugruppen* initiatives. Planned for nine residential units on a 940m² plot, the development achieves an optimal balance between the efficiencies of collective development and the manageability of group decision-making processes.

The project follows the standard four-phase process, with professional facilitation from AREA agency, which moderated monthly group meetings and supported the selection of project partners including architects and building services engineers. Within a year, the project had secured a land option, established its planning company (Planungs-GbR), and reserved approximately half of its units (Baugemeinschaft Eschengarten, 2025). This efficient timeline demonstrates how structured professional support can accelerate the development process.

Südlicht's legal structure illustrates the model's approach to risk management. The evolution from Planning GbR through Building GbR to final homeowners' association provides a framework that balances collective action during development with individual ownership rights after completion. As resident Andrea Reichert-Clauß explained: "We were skeptical at first... after all, building yourself is complex. You feel at the mercy of so many coincidences." The professional support structure mitigated these concerns through procedural clarity and expert guidance.

The project's demographic composition reflects the model's appeal to urban middle-class families. Most future residents originated from the central Prenzlauer Berg district, seeking to maintain their urban lifestyle while gaining access to more family-friendly housing. The location offered an ideal balance: a quiet residential street providing both tranquility and bicycle-distance access to their former neighborhood.

Community development represents a distinctive success of the project. The communal garden, accessible to all residents, functions as a focal point for interaction. As Reichert-Clauß observes, "The social and communicative aspects of a building group were especially important to us... Usually, a house community develops only after years of living together. For us, it happened even before moving in." This social cohesion, established during the planning process, represents a significant advantage over conventional housing delivery systems.

The project achieved competitive pricing (2100 eur/m2) by eliminating developer margins, which enabled high-quality materials and customization while maintaining affordability—exemplifying the *Baugruppen* model's balanced approach to quality and cost considerations.

### Building Group K20 in Berlin-Friedrichshain

The K20 project in Berlin-Friedrichshain presents an innovative variation on the traditional *Baugruppen* approach. Unlike Südlicht's more conventional group-led approach, K20 originated when two private individuals purchased a 693m² plot at auction, subsequently partnered with architects to develop the concept, and then recruited additional group members (BBSR, 2009). This "initiator-led" approach represents a hybrid between traditional developer-led projects and pure collective self-development that may hold particular relevance for markets new to the *Baugruppen* concept.

The project's timeline illustrates how professional support and clear leadership can accelerate the development process. Following the land purchase in September 2005, the initiators collaborated with architects to develop the design concept, established the planning company in July 2006, and completed group formation by January 2007. Through this process, the project expanded to include 15 participants combining individuals seeking affordable housing with others interested in experimental building approaches.

K20's mixed-use program of nine residential and two commercial units reflects a sophisticated urban approach to collective self-development. The six-story building occupies a development gap in Kreutzigerstraße, demonstrating how building groups can activate underutilized urban sites. The architectural design balances individual customization with collective identity. Each floor contains approximately 180m² divided flexibly into two apartments, with all units organized around a services shaft that facilitates customized configurations. The building achieves a generous 3.14m clear room height by foregoing an additional floor, creating exceptional living spaces that would be unlikely in conventional development.

Communal areas include a roof terrace with solar panels, sauna, multifunctional room, and shared garden, fostering community interaction while respecting private spatial domains. At 16% lower cost for square meter than the district's average, K20 achieved remarkable value despite its high energy and finishing standards. This success derives partly from the residents' direct involvement in construction management, with each member overseeing specific building trades (roedig.schop architekten, 2025).

The project maintained the typical three-stage legal evolution through Planning GbR, Building GbR, and finally homeowners' association, demonstrating how the standard *Baugruppen* framework can accommodate innovative initiation and management approaches while delivering substantial quality-of-life enhancements and cost advantages.

### Summary: Adapting the Baugruppen Model to the Polish Context

The German Baugruppen model offers a promising approach for addressing Poland's housing challenges, but successful adaptation requires careful consideration of local conditions. The Baugruppen model's emphasis on individual ownership within a collective framework aligns well with Polish cultural preferences, where homeownership is strongly prioritized as a marker of life success while financial savings represent the primary motivation for considering alternative housing models.

Germany's case shows that municipal support is very beneficial but not always required for implementation. However, given the track record of developing high quality, affordable housing, fostering long-term neighborhood community and developing in otherwise difficult locations, collective self-development might start to be seen favorably by Polish municipalities. Their assistance might begin with minimal models featuring single contact points within existing departments, gradually expanding as the concept gains traction. Land allocation policies would need particular attention, as access to appropriately zoned urban land represents a significant barrier in Poland's developer-dominated market. Performance-based reservation systems similar to Tübingen's six-month periods with extension options could provide a balanced approach that both supports building groups and protects municipal interests.

Professional facilitation would be essential but would need to be developed largely from scratch, as Poland lacks the established network of building group supervisors found in Germany. This represents both a challenge and an opportunity for creating a new professional field aligned with local needs.

The initiator-led approach demonstrated by K20 may prove especially relevant for Poland, as collective self-development concept remains unfamiliar to most potential participants. Architects, forward-thinking municipalities, or entrepreneurial individuals could serve as catalysts, acquiring land or options and then recruiting participants around a developed concept. This approach reduces initial uncertainty for participants while maintaining the core benefits of collective self-development. Medium-sized projects of 9-15 units would represent an ideal starting point, balancing the efficiencies of collective action with manageable group dynamics for this novel approach.

Rebranding represents a final critical consideration for Polish implementation. As cooperatism researchers noted, housing cooperatives in Poland carry the stigma of the socialist era, despite their core principle of collective action remaining valid (Corduroy de Lille, 2015; Skorupska, 2024). The Baugruppen model demonstrates how traditional cooperative housing concepts can be successfully reframed to appeal to a younger demographic. This rebranding approach, combined with targeted pilot projects demonstrating tangible benefits, could help overcome initial skepticism and establish collective self-development as a viable "third way" in Poland's housing market.

## Experimental initiatives in Poland

While collective self-development has historical roots dating to the nineteenth century in Poland, contemporary implementations emerged only in the 2010s through pioneering projects in Gdynia and Wrocław. The emergence of these projects coincides with growing recognition of what Skorupska (2024) identifies as the "rent gap"—a segment of the Polish population with incomes too high for state housing assistance yet insufficient for conventional market-rate housing acquisition.

Additional boost to the topic of collective self-development was given by the 'Ustawa o kooperatywach mieszkaniowych' from 2022, which introduced a legal form for collective self-development.

Initiatives represent distinct approaches to collaborative housing that reflect Poland's unique socioeconomic context and cultural preferences, with the contemporary collective self-development landscape characterized by two contrasting implementation models that demonstrate the concept's adaptability to different institutional contexts.

The "Kooperatywa Pomorze" in Gdynia exemplifies a bottom-up, citizen-led approach developed entirely through grassroots initiative without governmental support. In contrast, "Kooperatywa Mieszkaniowa Nowe Żerniki" in Wrocław represents a municipality-supported model that demonstrates how institutional frameworks can facilitate collective self-development. 

### Kooperatywa Mieszkaniowa Nowe Żerniki

The Kooperatywa Mieszkaniowa Nowe Żerniki represents Poland's most direct adaptation of the German Baugruppen model, established within a broader urban development framework. Initiated in 2011 as part of a comprehensive greenfield project, this initiative drew inspiration from both contemporary German collaborative housing practices and Wrocław's own architectural heritage—specifically the 1929 WuWa exhibition that showcased innovative housing solutions during the modernist period. This historical connection provided cultural legitimacy to what might otherwise have been perceived as a foreign housing concept.

The Wrocław municipality played a decisive role in establishing this initiative through a multifaceted support framework. City officials visited Berlin specifically to examine Baugruppen implementations, subsequently developing proposal templates for joint project implementation agreements based on German experiences (Habitat for 
Humanity Poland, 2025). The municipality's commitment extended beyond knowledge transfer to include concrete policy interventions that addressed key implementation barriers. Most significantly, the city designated three plots in Nowe Żerniki district specifically for housing cooperatives, offering them through perpetual usufruct arrangements that reduced land costs by approximately 80% compared to market sale prices (Lis et al., 2022). This intervention directly addressed what research has identified as the primary obstacle for collective self-development in Poland's developer-dominated urban land market.

The municipality enhanced project viability through carefully designed selection criteria that balanced financial considerations with qualitative factors. The auction process for cooperative plots excluded commercial entities from participation and evaluated proposals based not only on price but also on conceptual quality, including floor plans, visualizations, and the design of common spaces. This approach ensured that the projects would achieve architectural quality while remaining financially viable. Additionally, municipal officials participated directly in negotiations with financial institutions, helping to legitimize the cooperative housing model and secure financing for participants when commercial banks proved reluctant (Habitat for Humanity Poland, 
2025).

The Nowe Żerniki initiative has achieved notable success in translating the collaborative housing concept into completed projects. The first cooperative building, formed by a group of ten friends who secured perpetual usufruct rights in early 2014, had already commenced construction by April 2015. Subsequent tenders resulted in additional cooperative buildings, creating what Lis et al. (2022) describe as "an engaged civil society on a micro-scale" within just a few years. The completed projects feature common spaces including stroller storage, bicycle facilities, and community rooms, with additional service spaces such as dental offices, kindergartens, and cafés integrated into the development.

Particularly noteworthy is the evolution of the model. Follow-up research reveals that three buildings function close to the cohousing form, emphasizing ongoing community interaction and resource sharing, while one project transformed over time into a form of collective self-development more similar to the construction group model seen in Gdynia's Pomorze project (Rataj, 2023). This diversity demonstrates the flexibility of collaborative housing approaches to accommodate different participant priorities and community dynamics. As one resident explained: "We started with approximately seventy-square-meter apartments, and ended up on average at one hundred meters," illustrating how the participatory design process allowed living spaces to evolve in response to changing family needs (Lis et al., 2022).

Despite these successes, the initiative encountered significant challenges that reveal systemic barriers to collaborative housing implementation in Poland. The most substantial obstacles emerged in the financing domain, where commercial banks demonstrated both conceptual resistance and practical limitations in accommodating collective borrowing arrangements. As one resident recounted, bank officials struggled with basic administrative procedures: "Sir, there are twelve people and I have only three boxes to enter the names." This institutional inflexibility reflects broader issues of limited regulatory frameworks for collaborative housing in Poland (Lis et al., 2022).


The Nowe Żerniki cooperative housing initiative represents a significant milestone in Poland's exploration of alternative housing delivery models. By combining municipal support with resident participation, the project has created housing that achieves both affordability improvements and enhanced quality of life. Participants report cost reductions of 20-30% compared to conventional market options while gaining access to shared resources that would be unaffordable individually. The project demonstrates how institutional support can overcome implementation barriers while allowing for adaptation to local conditions and participant preferences.

### Kooperatywa Pomorze

Kooperatywa Pomorze emerged as the first collective self-development initiative in the country since World War II. Founded in 2012 in the Chwarzno-Wiczlino district of Gdynia, this grassroots housing cooperative was initiated by Roman Paczkowski, who drew inspiration from Scandinavian housing models (Sobolak, 2023). The project emerged in response to pressing housing affordability challenges, particularly for young families facing limited access to conventional housing markets.

Unlike Nowe Żerniki in Wrocław, Kooperatywa Pomorze developed entirely through grassroots initiative without municipal or institutional support. The cooperative was formed by several families—both friends and strangers—who collectively managed the entire development process from land acquisition through design to construction completion. The cooperative's approach was characterized by a singular focus on cost reduction and individual ownership rather than community-building or shared facilities. This fundamental distinction positions it as a pure construction group within the collaborative housing typology (Rataj, 2023). As Paczkowski explains, "ownership is the basic idea and principle of a cooperative" (Sobolak, 2023). This pragmatic orientation stemmed from the founders' primary motivation: providing affordable housing for young families who could not access conventional market options.

Kooperatywa Pomorze's achievements extend beyond its initial implementation. The cooperative successfully completed four consecutive projects in Gdynia, providing housing for 36 families in total (Kutypa et al., 2018). The cost advantages proved substantial and consistent across implementations. According to Paczkowski, two Kooperatywa Pomorze projects achieved documented savings of 37% (Sobolak, 2023). These savings derived from eliminating developer profit margins and other overhead costs inherent in commercial development.

Perhaps most significantly, the cooperative model expanded housing access to previously excluded demographics. Paczkowski notes that "almost half of the participants did not have the ability to buy an apartment from a developer or on the secondary market, but had this ability when implementing their own cooperative" (Sobolak, 2023). This democratization of housing access represents a meaningful contribution to addressing Poland's "rent gap" (Skorupska, 2024).

The success of Kooperatywa Pomorze catalyzed broader interest in the cooperative housing model throughout Poland. Information about the project spread via social media, attracting visitors from across the country seeking to replicate its approach. Moreover, Paczkowski, together with the Habitat for Humanity Foundation, leveraged the cooperative's success to advocate for legislative recognition, ultimately contributing to the passage of the Housing Cooperatives Act in 2022.

Despite its achievements, Kooperatywa Pomorze faced significant challenges that highlight the limitations of its approach. Financing represented the most formidable obstacle, with major Polish banks initially reluctant to support the cooperative model despite accepting its business plan. As Paczkowski recounts, "Banks feared that when multiple investors focused on a single goal, misunderstandings could easily arise, threatening the implementation of the investment" (Sobolak, 2023). The cooperative eventually secured financing through a smaller cooperative bank after nearly two months of negotiations, illustrating the structural barriers facing alternative housing models in Poland's financial system.

The cooperative also encountered indifference from municipal authorities, receiving no support from local government in terms of land allocation, regulatory assistance, or infrastructure coordination. This lack of institutional engagement contrasts sharply with the Wrocław municipality's proactive approach to supporting housing cooperatives through land allocation, legal templates, and financing negotiations.

The cooperative's singular focus on cost reduction and individual ownership also produced certain disadvantages. Critics note that the cooperative's utilitarian approach resulted in limited architectural ambition (Kutypa et al., 2018). The projects utilized ready-made designs that did not include common spaces except for gardens accessible to all residents. These choices prioritized cost efficiency over architectural quality, contextual sensitivity and community-building (Lis et al. 2022).

Kooperatywa Pomorze stands as a pioneering example of collective self-development, demonstrating both the potential and limitations of grassroots housing initiatives. The cooperative's achievement of substantial cost reductions, completion of multiple successful projects, and expansion of housing access to previously excluded demographics represents a significant contribution to addressing housing affordability challenges. However, the cooperative's experience also highlights the importance of institutional support, urban integration, and balanced priorities beyond cost reduction alone. Importantly, the challenges encountered by Kooperatywa Pomorze informed subsequent policy developments, including the 2022 Housing Cooperatives Act, which aims to provide a more supportive framework for future initiatives.

### Summary of pioneering CSD in Poland

The pioneering collective self-development initiatives in Poland—Kooperatywa Pomorze and Nowe Żerniki—demonstrate the model's adaptability while revealing contrasting implementation approaches. Despite their methodological differences, both projects delivered significant benefits that align with the theoretical advantages of collective self-development: cost reductions of 20-30% compared to conventional market options, enhanced design flexibility during planning, and the development of supportive social networks (Skorupska, 2024; Lis et al., 2022).

The implementation strategies, however, diverged substantially. Nowe Żerniki, benefiting from municipal support through land allocation and legal frameworks, emphasized community spaces and social integration within a comprehensive urban development framework. This institutional approach facilitated higher architectural quality and urban coherence but primarily served middle to upper-income demographics. In contrast, Kooperatywa Pomorze developed through purely grassroots initiative without institutional support, prioritizing cost minimization and individual ownership at the expense of common areas and urban integration. This utilitarian approach successfully expanded housing access to previously excluded demographics but sacrificed opportunities for community-building features that characterize more comprehensive collaborative housing models (Lis et al., 2022).

These contrasting approaches highlight flexibility as a fundamental advantage of collective self-development in addressing Poland's housing challenges. The ideal implementation would combine Pomorze's grassroots affordability with Nowe Żerniki's institutional framework and urban and social qualities. These pioneering projects offer complementary insights for developing a "third way" between developer-built and individual self-build housing that responds to the country's specific cultural and economic context.

## Gaps in State of the Art

While both German and Polish examples demonstrate the viability of collective self-development models, several critical gaps emerge when comparing these approaches. German Baugruppen projects have achieved maturity through decades of implementation, creating established frameworks and professional support systems. In contrast, Polish initiatives remain in an experimental phase, adapting various aspects of collaborative housing without fully developed methodologies or support structures. Identifying these gaps is essential for developing a more effective approach to collective self-development in Poland.

### Procedural Framework Deficiencies

The most significant gap between German and Polish implementations lies in procedural clarity and professional facilitation. The Baugruppen model's success derives substantially from its clearly defined four-phase progression: Interest Community, Planning Community, Building Community, and Owner Community. This staged approach allows participants to join at different phases according to their risk tolerance and desired level of involvement, while providing clear milestones and decision points throughout the development process.

Polish initiatives, by contrast, typically attempt to establish what might be termed an "Everything Community" from the outset—requiring participants to simultaneously address group formation, site selection, planning, and construction management without clear procedural boundaries. This approach significantly increases complexity and risk perception, particularly given that some participants naturally prefer higher involvement while others seek more finished solutions.

A more structured approach could involve a core group of highly committed individuals (as few as three, the minimum required for a under the Act on Housing Cooperatives) handling the initial phases before onboarding additional members for the building community stage. This phased approach would reduce the risk of member turnover while simplifying early decision-making processes. The absence of such procedural clarity represents a significant missed opportunity for Polish initiatives to reduce complexity and increase appeal to potential participants.

Professional services specifically tailored to cooperative housing represent another critical gap in Poland's collective self-development landscape. While German projects benefit from specialized agencies that provide expert facilitation, Polish initiatives rely primarily on independent trailblazers without access to established professional support networks. This absence increases the burden on participants while potentially reducing efficiency and increasing risk. As demonstrated by both Südlicht and K20 projects, professional guidance significantly reduces development timelines. The absence of these specialized services in Poland represents a substantial obstacle to wider adoption of collective self-development models.

### Strategic Market Positioning

Current approaches to collective self-development in Poland have yet to develop sophisticated strategies for land acquisition and market positioning. Kooperatywa Pomorze succeeded partly because its chosen plot was unattractive for a developer due to size and configuration, while Nowe Żerniki relied on municipal land allocation specifically reserved for cooperatives (Sobolak, 2023; Lis et al., 2022). In the absence of such formal allocation policies and rather than directly competing with developers for prime locations, successful collective self-development requires identifying strategic niches within the land market. The most promising opportunities lie in plots that are too small or awkwardly shaped to attract developer interest but too large for individual self-builders. Moreover, future initiatives would benefit from targeting specific site types such as urban infill locations (similar to Berlin's K20 project), brownfield redevelopments, or urban renewal areas—creating value in locations that commercial developers might initially overlook.

Demographic targeting represents another underdeveloped aspect of market positioning for Polish initiatives. Collective self-development appears most effective when targeted specifically at demographics underserved by conventional development approaches. Young urban families seeking larger, centrally-located apartments represent an especially promising demographic, as they often face significant challenges in finding suitable housing within developer-dominated markets that prioritize smaller, investment-oriented units. Despite this potential alignment, current Polish initiatives have not fully articulated or leveraged this strategic positioning in their development and marketing approaches.

Public perception challenges continue to hinder wider adoption of collective self-development in Poland. Despite potential advantages, cooperative housing continues to face association with socialist-era housing cooperatives (spółdzielnie mieszkaniowe), which many younger Poles perceive negatively (Corduroy de Lille, 2015; Skorupska, 2024). Effective branding represents a critical gap in current approaches. A successful rebranding should appeal to proud, entrepreneurial individuals who believe they can achieve better results than conventional developers. This reframing, similar to how the Baugruppen concept reinvigorated cooperative principles in Germany, could help overcome initial skepticism while attracting participants who might otherwise dismiss collaborative housing options.

### Tensions Between Economic and Social considerations

Existing Polish initiatives reveal an unresolved tension between economic optimization and community development. Kooperatywa Pomorze achieved impressive cost reductions but sacrificed common areas and architectural ambition (Kutypa et al., 2018). While this approach successfully increased housing access, it missed opportunities to leverage collective purchasing power for shared amenities that could enhance long-term resident satisfaction.

The ideal approach would balance cost considerations with strategic investments in common spaces and architectural quality. Shared resources become affordable when costs are distributed. However, projects must carefully manage this balance to avoid "scope creep" that could undermine the fundamental affordability advantage—if the cooperative becomes more expensive than a developer, it ceases to fulfill its primary purpose. The absence of clear frameworks for identifying and implementing high-value common elements while maintaining overall affordability represents a significant gap in current Polish approaches.

Current implementations also lack sufficient flexibility to accommodate the evolving preferences of community members. Since how a cooperative will evolve cannot be fully predicted prior to development, projects should incorporate adaptive frameworks that permit independent living for privacy-oriented residents while accommodating greater sharing for those who prefer more communal arrangements. Both German and Polish examples demonstrate significant evolution during the development process, with residents in Nowe Żerniki having radically transformed their spatial requirements during planning (Lis et al., 2022). This adaptability represents an essential feature for accommodating changing participant needs and preferences, yet few projects explicitly design for this flexibility from the outset.

### Institutional Challenges

While municipal support significantly facilitates collective self-development, current approaches have not developed effective strategies for securing institutional backing. The Nowe Żerniki experience demonstrates the substantial advantages of municipal involvement, including land allocation, legal templates, and assistance with financing negotiations (Habitat for Humanity Poland, 2025). However, as Kooperatywa Pomorze's experience shows, cooperatives cannot rely on municipal support, particularly in the early stages when the benefits of collective self-development remain poorly understood by stakeholders (Sobolak, 2023).

Future initiatives would benefit from strategically addressing municipal priorities to increase support likelihood, potentially by incorporating elements that provide direct community benefits beyond housing. Cooperatives could provide municipalities with assets that serve broader community needs and this would in turn unlock the benefits of institutional support and specific provisions in the 2022 Act on Housing Cooperatives, that were unavailable to earlier initiatives.


## Bridging Theory to Practice: From Identified Gaps to Objectives

The analysis of existing collective self-development models has revealed four critical domains where current implementations fall short: procedural frameworks, strategic market positioning, balancing economic and social benefits, and institutional engagement. These gaps represent practical obstacles that hinder the wider adoption of an otherwise promising housing delivery approach.

Rather than attempting to address all possible improvements to collective self-development, this project focuses on elements that would most significantly enhance viability and appeal in the Polish context. The emphasis on procedural clarity addresses the "Everything Community" problem that has complicated early Polish initiatives, while the focus on strategic market positioning acknowledges the reality of Poland's developer-dominated land market. Similarly, the objectives related to balancing economic and social benefits respond directly to the tension observed between Pomorze's cost-focused approach and Nowe Żerniki's community orientation. These objectives collectively aim to address the fundamental challenge identified in the analysis: how to transform collective self-development from a merely innovative concept to a genuinely desirable housing alternative.

## Procedural Objectives

To address the lack of clear procedural frameworks in current Polish initiatives, this project will implement a structured development process modeled after four-stage building groups. Project is conceptualized as following the K20 approach, where a small, focused group acquired a suitable site and developed an architectural proposal (completing the Interest Community and Planning Community phases, so it can be presented as ready for Building Community formation), thereby reducing complexity for potential participants.

Since in this approach the Building Community members are not involved earlier but still expect a level of customization characteristic of collective self-development, the project will ensure flexibility in the design. The project will develop at a total scale of 9-15 residential units—large enough to achieve meaningful economies of scale while remaining manageable for group decision-making processes. This size aligns with successful German implementations while avoiding the excessive complexity that can arise in larger collaborative projects. The total size of the development will be fixed to sufficiently exploit the land but the number and mix of units will be subject to change.


## Market Positioning Objectives

In response to the challenges of market positioning and land acquisition, the project will target a specific demographic currently underserved by conventional development: young urban families and individuals with high agency who seek larger, customized apartments in central locations. This demographic alignment focuses on participants with both the motivation and capacity to engage in a collaborative development process.

The project will identify and develop a site that occupies the middle segment of the land market—zoned for multi-family residential but possessing characteristics that make it unattractive to conventional developers. By focusing on brownfield, urban infill, or urban renewal locations, the project will create value in areas overlooked by conventional development. This strategic site selection will demonstrate how collective self-development can succeed without relying on municipal land allocation.

## Economic and Social Objectives

To resolve the tension between economic optimization and community development evident in existing projects, this project will incorporate thoughtfully designed communal amenities that enhance long-term resident satisfaction while maintaining overall affordability. By identifying high-value common elements that become economically viable through cost-sharing, the project will demonstrate how collective development can achieve quality-of-life enhancements that would be unaffordable individually.

The project will demonstrate measurable cost savings compared to equivalent developer-built housing options, quantifying the economic advantage. This analysis will include a comprehensive cost breakdown that identifies specific sources of savings and strategic investments, supporting both financing efforts and participant decision-making. By clearly articulating the economic case while highlighting quality-of-life enhancements, the project will address the common misconception that collaborative housing necessarily involves significant compromises.

## Institutional and Perception Objectives

To overcome institutional barriers to cooperative housing, the project will emphasise community benefit through developing commercial or mixed-use spaces that provide direct value to the surrounding neighborhood. These spaces will create clear benefits for municipal stakeholders, potentially serving as a basis for negotiating favorable terms for land acquisition or regulatory approval. By demonstrating how collective self-development can contribute to broader urban revitalization, the project will position these initiatives as valuable partners in addressing municipal priorities.

The project will identify specific provisions of the 2022 Housing Cooperatives Act that can be leveraged to facilitate implementation, creating a model for how future initiatives can navigate this relatively new legal framework.

# Methods

First let's outline the procedure.
0. Envision
1. find a plot
2. analyse the feasibility of the plot
3. Develop architectural wireframe while keeping flexibility7


## Envisioning
- Poznań was chosen as the general location for the project
- a middle size apartment block for 9-15 households in a central location
- aimed at young entrepreneurial families that aim higher in life than the developer slop
- with cost-effective amenities (for example where an apartment will be bad (ground floor))
- with commercial or communal spaces included

## Site selection
To find a site suitable for the development as envisioned the city of Poznań was chosen. Since the project is aimed at families that would like to live an urban lifestyle, the search had to be narrowed down to environments that support this lifestyle.

The conditions of urban environment are characterized by sufficient density, access to amenities, mixed-use development, and built form defining clear public spaces. As classification of Poznań's districts is not the main topic of the thesis, the maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) in planning zones was chosen as the proxy for urban environment.

The zoning data from provisional General Plan of Poznań (as of January 2025) was used. The General plan divides the city into planning zones, and in each of the zones describes the list of permitted uses and basic urban form measures - Floor Area Ratio, Building Site Coverage, Building Height and Green Area Coverage.

Figure shows the map of planning zones in Poznań, with those permitting multi-family residential use colored according to the maximum FAR permitted. The analysis shows that consolidated areas with planning zones permitting moderate-to-high FAR correspond to the cadastral districts of Poznań, Jezyce, Łazarz and Wilda. Poznań cadastral district which encompasses the city center was excluded as being out of reach for a cooperative due to competition and land prices.

These three chosen districts include mostly XIXth century developments surrounding the medieval core of the city. These are dense areas with a variety of uses, amenities, and well-defined network of public streets and squares therfore filling the definition of environment supporting an urban lifestyle.

Moreover, since these areas are mostly developed, the expected empty plots should include urban infill or redevelopment sites aligning with the objective of strategic market positioning.

To enable collective self-build development and avoid direct competition with professional developers an ideal plot would be zoned for high density multi-family while not being large enough to be feassible for developers.

Polish cadaster data (Ewidencja Gruntów i Budynków) was used to find potential sites. All plots in cadaster districts Jezyce, Łazarz and Wilda were imported and the data was preprocessed to exclude sites not feasible for development. All developed plots, plots smaller than 200m2, not-buildable plots (roads, parks, water bodies etc.), awkwardly shaped plots (with shape index lower than 0.3) were excluded.

The remaining plots were intersected with planning zones allowing for FAR greater than 4. This produced a list of 43 locations consists of empty plots, zoned for multi-family residential development in urban environments. All plots are either urban infill or redevelopments. The redevelopments include the sites of former chocalate factory in Jezyce, H. Cegielski factory in Wilda and railroad company in Łazarz.

Bigger plots and groups of adjacent plots that can be joined are perfect for real estate developers and therefore are hard competition for collective self-build. These sites were excluded. To finalize the choice of the site investment map of poznan municipality was used (Poznań, 2025). It's an online list of properties that Poznań wants to develop in the future. Given the objective of providing clear neighborhood benefit to win municipal support the only site of that meets the previous criteria and is part of that list was chosen.

The site is Gąsiorowskich 6. It is located in Łazarz. It's a former railway company site located in close proximity to main railway station. Łazarz neighbourhood is vibrant with retail, parks, farmers market (rynek łazarski), fair grounds (międzynarodowe targi poznańskie) nearby. It is well connected with the city center by tram line. Additionally, premetro (Poznański Szybki Tramwaj) station is nearby.

The site is 600 sqm rectangular urban infill site and is currently used as a parking. It is directly fronting the street (from Southwest), a 6-story residential building from northwest, back yard currently used as warehouses and a single story store from the southeast.
A large plot nearby is currently being redeveloped by a developer which will serve as a perfect comparison point to collective self-build. 
*Site is not covered by a local plan which under Polish law requires going through a procedure of obtaining development conditions from the municipality.* maybe use the general plan provisions 

## Develpment conditions 

The general plan specifies maximum allowable for the site:
- FAR 7.6
- BSC 0.95
- Building height 27m
- Green area 0.3

- municipal support is beneficial but coops can't rely on it (at least in the begginning when the benefits are not well understood by stakeholders)
- clear procedures and professional services make baugruppen model successful - in Poland its mostly trailblazers and there are not established service offer for cooperatives. - successful german project have assistance from professionals (AREA, Baugruppe Architect)
- a tested procedure is 4 stages (interest community, planning community, building community, ownership community). Polish project try to get everything right in one go (everything community), which makes it way harder. Since some people are naturally more involved, while others prefer a ready-solution it makes sense to involve them at different stages. In most extreme scenario a group of 3 (the least amount of people needed for a coop), can go through the interest and planning process - buy land, design, get permit - an onboard additional members already for the building community stage. This will also limit the risk of member turnover. Clear procedures address and mitigate perceived risks from the beginning.
- coop is better when it is targeted at people who cannot be easily served by a developer (eg. young urban families), Gdynia was people who didnt get a better space because of the coop, but they got any space. 
- instead of competing with developers for land, it's best when coops go for underapreciated land where the competition is lower. This can be either a plot that is small enough (or zoned low) that it won't be economically viable for a developer and big enough (or zoned high) that it will be out of reach for individual investors; or a plot in a location that is not considered prime development area - think urban infills, redevelopment in early phases, urban renewal areas. Both Gdynia and Wrocław projects were developed in areas that are under a lot of developer-led construction. Gdynia succeeded because the plot size and shape was very unattractive for a developer. Wrocław succeeded because the municipality set aside land to be sold only to cooperatives. In lack of such a policy, a coop project should rather target specific sites such as K20's urban infill site.
- polish project should specifically use the provisions of Act on housing cooperatives. Easier access to municipal land is conditional on the eagerness of the municipality. But municipality may be more eager if there is something in it for them. For example coop may be able to pay back for the plot in apartments or commercial area
- Gdynia was purely an economic project - in that sense it was very successful. But also they missed out on the big benefits of a coop - the ability to afford luxuries because of collective purchasing power. The lack of common ares, also meant that it is harder to realize satisfaction gains from living in a great community. A good coop should aim to realize this benefit. On the other hand project has to be wary of scope creep - if the cooperative becomes more expensive then developer it stops to make sense.
- also - how the coop will evolve is unkown prior to development. So it should stay flexible - eg. if the participants dont go along, they should be able to mind their business. But if the participants are happy to do more cohousing - the project should be able to accomodate that.
- branding is important - projects dont' attract if they feel too much like spółdzielnia. It also has to be branded as very beneficial to the city. As having the city on board is shown to make the process much easier.
- financing is a major hurdle but it is out of scope for this thesis. However a detail cost analysis can be beneficial to aid in financing 

General objective is a 2nd wave project - not only innovative, but also desirable. Like first there was Prius that competed with hummer, but only Tesla made it sexy to own an electric car.

For it to be desirable it has to address concerns - mainly be fairly easy, understandable, with clear benefits and mitigated risks.

Specific objectives:
1. A 9-15 unit collective self-development project
2. Clear target group - young urban families, people with high agency, that want something better than on the market (that want big, customised central apartments) and are willing to get involved to get it
3. Location - a plot that is zoned for multi-family residential, but not big enough to be attractive for a developer; preferably a brownfield, urban infill or renewal location.
4. Develop the design as if Implementing K20's procedure - go theoretically through interest community and planning community - present the project as if looking for a building community
4. Allow for communal amenities as this can ensure long-term satisfaction
5. Develop commercial space to bring value to the city, potentially get extra rent or pay back for municipal land
3. Demonstrate saving vs. a comparable developer 
8. Demonstrate benefit for the city and neighbourhood 
4. Show a detail cost breakdown to ease financing concerns 
3. Branding - a new way of coopertism; not like spoldzielnia; for entrepreneurial active amazing people that are better developer than developer - self-development
