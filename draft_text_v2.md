## Housing affordability crisis

Rising living costs represent the primary concern for residents across developed nations (Ipsos, 2025). In Europe, housing affordability emerged as a particularly critical challenge as the housing market has experienced price growth that significantly outpaces general inflation. Between 2015 and 2023, residential property prices increased by an average of 48% across the European Union, whereas in Poland by 79.8% (Eurostat, 2023). The political importance of this issue is evident in voting patterns, as housing affordability became the leading motivation for voter participation in the 2024 European elections (Eurobarometer, 2024).

This exceptional price growth results from multiple factors affecting both market supply and demand. On the supply side, construction activity faces limitations from increasing building material costs and persistent labor shortages. On the demand side, the housing market has transformed as properties increasingly serve as investment vehicles rather than primarily as homes. High interest rates have further complicated this situation by raising financing costs for middle-income buyers seeking to purchase homes (Eurostat, 2023).

Poland presents a particularly instructive case of these affordability challenges. Research by the European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion (ESPON) has identified a distinctive pattern in Poland's housing market. While most European countries show right-skewed housing price distributions—meaning lower-priced housing predominates—Poland exhibits an approximately normal distribution. This pattern, when considered alongside Poland's income distribution (where median income falls substantially below average income), reveals a structural mismatch between housing supply and affordability needs (Statistics Poland, 2024).

The affordability problem becomes most severe for families seeking appropriately sized housing. When examining the financial requirements for a 100m² unit—a size typically needed by families—Poland ranks among the European Union's least accessible housing markets. Many regions require more than one person's complete income for renting such units or demand over 35 years of dedicating 40% of annual income for purchase (ESPON, 2024). Lack of adequate housing is shown as a major factor in driving suburbanization as young families cannot find

## Structure of housing supply

Poland's construction sector has achieved remarkable output levels. Between 2016 and 2021, the sector delivered more new dwellings than the entire housing stock of Warsaw (Lis et al. 2023). However, this impressive quantity masks a concerning lack of diversity in housing delivery methods. The market is highly concentrated, with real estate developers and individual investors accounting for nearly all new housing stock. In 2024, of 199,931 new housing units, 62% came from developers, 35% from individual investors, and only 3% from housing cooperatives and other non-market actors (Statistics Poland, 2025).

This market structure presents prospective homeowners with a binary choice: developer-built units or self-build single-family houses. These options represent fundamentally different approaches to housing development, each with distinct characteristics and trade-offs.

Developer-built housing dominates the multi-family sector. Real estate developers manage the entire development process from land acquisition through construction to sales, focusing on risk management, feasibility analysis, and market alignment (Graaskamp, 1992). Operating as risk-minimizing enterprises, they prioritize standardized designs and mainstream market segments, typically delivering either multi-family buildings with investor-friendly smaller units or standardized single-family houses (BBSR, 2009).

The developer model offers several advantages, particularly in terms of scale and efficiency. These firms undertake large-scale projects to offset fixed costs, operating almost exclusively in urban and suburban areas with appropriate zoning. They provide buyers with a hands-off experience and regulatory protections. But this convenience comes at a cost—the developer-built housing includes significant profit margins (20-30%) and prioritizes short-term returns over long-term operating expenditure (National Bank of Poland, 2024).

At the other end of the spectrum, self-build housing represents an entirely different approach. Individual investors directly manage their development, typically creating single-family houses or duplexes in rural or suburban locations. While self-builders assume full financial and project management risk, they gain complete control over design and customization. This approach eliminates developer margins but requires significant personal involvement and expertise in construction management.

This stark contrast in development approaches has created pronounced market segmentation. Developers dominate urban areas with large-scale, standardized projects, while individual self-builders operate primarily in rural or suburban locations with available smaller plots.

## Collective self-development as an alternative

One promising approach to bridging this market gap is collaborative housing, an umbrella term encompassing various forms of resident-led development. At its core, collaborative housing involves significant coordination between future residents and other stakeholders throughout the development process, with residents actively participating in planning, design, and sometimes construction while maintaining individual autonomy in their living spaces (Czischke et al., 2021).

While diverse forms of collaborative housing have gained traction across Europe, implementing such models in Poland requires careful consideration of the local context. Research indicates that collaborative housing faces several cultural and practical barriers in Poland. Young Poles strongly prioritize individual homeownership, viewing it as a marker of life success, and generally resist shared living arrangements. Financial savings emerge as the primary motivation, while concerns about lengthy development processes, limited space, and shared ownership structures act as significant deterrents (Lis et al., 2023).

Given these cultural preferences and constraints, this thesis focuses specifically on collective self-development as the most promising collaborative housing model for the Polish market. This approach maintains individual ownership—aligning with local preferences—while leveraging the benefits of group coordination.

The following table illustrates how collective self-development positions itself as a "third way" between traditional developer-built and individual self-build housing:

| Characteristic | Developer-built Housing | Collective Self-development | Self-build Housing |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Scale | Large developments | Medium-sized projects (10-20 units) | Single units or duplexes |
| Location | Urban and suburban areas with existing zoning | Urban and semi-urban areas with municipal support | Rural and suburban areas, including agricultural land |
| Project Risk | Assumed by developer; buyer protected by regulations | Shared among group members; partially mitigated by collective approach | Fully assumed by the owner-builder |
| Economies of Scale | Significant cost advantages in materials and labor | Moderate economies of scale through collective purchasing | None; each project unique |
| Customization | Limited; standardized designs | Balanced; individual units within collective framework | Full customization possible |
| Buyer Involvement | Minimal; turnkey solution | Moderate to high; shared decision-making process | Extensive; manages entire process |
| Cost Structure | Includes 20-30% developer margin | No developer margin; shared overhead costs | No developer margin; direct costs only |
| Time Horizon | Short-term focus; limited post-sale involvement | Medium to long-term; emphasis on community building | Long-term perspective on maintenance and operations |
| Target Market | Investment-oriented buyers, first-time homeowners seeking convenience | Urban middle-class families seeking affordability and community | Families seeking customization and cost control |

# State of the art

Collective self-development represents a significant innovation in housing delivery systems that has emerged across various global contexts (Palmer, 2020; Barenstein & Pfister, 2019). To better understand the potential and challenges of implementing collective self-development in Poland, we can examine the mature German *Baugruppen* model alongside pioneering Polish initiatives.

## German Baugruppen model

Germany's *Baugruppen* (building groups) model stands as a particularly instructive case study that has evolved from experimental beginnings to achieve substantial market presence. *Baugruppen* are groups of people that participate in the planning, design, and sometimes construction of multi-unit housing projects while maintaining individual ownership of their units. The model adapts Germany's earlier *Genossenschaften* (cooperative) tradition for contemporary contexts. Beginning as isolated projects among friend networks in the 1970s, *Baugruppen* gained momentum in the mid-1990s through systematic implementation in Tübingen and Freiburg's urban conversion areas. This evolution from marginal experiment to established practice has resulted in the model now accounting for approximately 15-17% of new housing production in Germany, demonstrating its viability at meaningful scale (Tummers, 2015; BBSR, 2009).

The *Baugruppen* approach addresses three fundamental housing policy challenges through its distinctive development methodology. First, it achieves substantial affordability improvements through the elimination of developer profit margins and the leveraging of collective negotiation power for financing and materials procurement. Second, the model fosters social cohesion by establishing neighborhood bonds during the early planning phase; these connections frequently evolve into enduring support networks that enhance residential satisfaction. Third, it enables housing quality by facilitating direct collaboration between residents and architects, thereby prioritizing sustainable materials and ecological considerations that are frequently subordinated in profit-oriented development (BBSR, 2009).

*Baugruppen* initiatives are often supported by German municipalities, which have developed institutional frameworks to facilitate the development process. Cities such as Freiburg, Berlin, Tübingen, and Hamburg have implemented comprehensive programs that combine direct promotion, public-private partnerships, and targeted incentives (Hamiduddin & Gallent, 2016). These typically encompass land allocation through six-month reservation periods with performance-based extensions; infrastructure support through meeting spaces and dedicated municipal contact persons; and public engagement through coordinated information campaigns (Droste, 2015).

The efficacy of the *Baugruppen* model derives substantially from professional facilitation and procedural clarity. With expert architectural and supervisory support, projects typically progress from initial meeting to construction commencement in 6-9 months, contrasting sharply with the 5-7 year timeline often experienced without professional guidance. This efficiency stems from a clearly articulated four-phase development process:

1. The Interest Community phase concentrates on group formation and site selection
2. The Planning Community phase establishes a civil law partnership and develops detailed architectural plans
3. The Building Community phase manages construction execution and project accounting
4. The Owner Community phase transitions the group into a legal community under the german law (BBSR, 2009)

Empirical research demonstrates that *Baugruppen* projects consistently deliver several advantages over conventional development approaches. The model facilitates stronger neighborly relationships while providing customized architectural solutions that reflect specific household requirements (Droste, 2015). Significantly, building groups often succeed in challenging locations rejected by traditional developers, creating high-quality developments in previously undervalued areas. Their projects demonstrate stronger orientation toward demand satisfaction and quality optimization than developer-led initiatives, thereby contributing to sustainable housing markets through long-term resident commitment and community-based initiatives (BBSR, 2009).

Nevertheless, the german model presents notable challenges. Practical difficulties include construction delays, financial uncertainties, and cost escalations resulting from member turnover. The mutual dependence between group members can lead to demanding deliberative processes and extended decision-making timelines (Seeman, 2019). Moreover, while collective self-development effectively serves middle-class households, its capacity to accommodate economically disadvantaged groups remains limited due to the required financial commitments and substantial personal involvement in the development process (Droste, 2015).

To showcase how these advantages and challenges manifest in practice, we can examine two contrasting *Baugruppen* projects that illustrate different approaches to implementation:

### Building Community "Südlicht" in Berlin-Pankow

The Südlicht project in Berlin-Pankow exemplifies the *Baugruppen* model's adaptation to established urban contexts. Initiated in 2006, this medium-scale development demonstrates the model's capacity to create high-quality housing in established urban neighborhoods. The project served as a pioneering development in the larger transformation of the Eschengraben area, subsequently inspiring several neighboring *Baugruppen* initiatives (Baugemeinschaft Eschengarten, 2025).

The project's scale and methodological approach align with typical *Baugruppen* characteristics. Planned for nine residential units on a 940m² plot, it represents an optimal balance between the efficiencies of collective development and the manageability of group decision-making processes. The development follows the standard four-phase process, with professional facilitation from AREA agency, which moderated monthly group meetings, assisted in recruiting new building families when necessary, and supported the selection of project partners including architects and building services engineers. Within a year, the project had secured a land option, established its planning company (Planungs-GbR), and reserved approximately half of its units.

Südlicht's legal structure illustrates the model's approach to risk management and community building. The three-stage evolution—from Planning GbR through Building GbR to final homeowners' association—provides a framework that balances collective action during development with individual ownership rights after completion. This structure addressed initial participant concerns regarding project risks, as articulated by resident Andrea Reichert-Clauß: "We were skeptical at first... after all, building yourself is complex. You feel at the mercy of so many coincidences." The professional support structure mitigated these concerns through procedural clarity and expert guidance (Baugemeinschaft Eschengarten, 2025).

The project's demographic composition reflects the model's appeal to urban middle-class families. Most future residents originated from the central Prenzlauer Berg district, seeking to maintain their urban lifestyle while gaining access to more family-friendly housing. The location offered an ideal balance: a quiet residential street at the border between Prenzlauer Berg and Pankow, providing both tranquility and bicycle-distance access to their former neighborhood. This strategic site selection reinforced the model's community-building aspects, as residents shared both physical proximity to their previous neighborhood and similar lifestyle preferences.

The communal garden, accessible to all residents, provides secure play areas for children and functions as a focal point for community interaction. As Reichert-Clauß observes, "The social and communicative aspects of a building group were especially important to us... Usually, a house community develops only after years of living together. For us, it happened even before moving in" (Baugemeinschaft Eschengarten, 2025).

 The project achieved competitive pricing for its location and quality level, illustrating the model's capacity to deliver value through collective action. This price point reflects the cost advantages of eliminated developer margins while accommodating high-quality materials and individual unit customization, demonstrating the balance between affordability and quality that characterizes successful *Baugruppen* developments.

### Building Group K20 in Berlin-Friedrichshain

The K20 project in Berlin-Friedrichshain presents an innovative variation on the traditional *Baugruppen* approach, demonstrating the model's flexibility in project initiation and group formation. Unlike Südlicht's more conventional group-led approach, K20 originated when two private individuals purchased a 693m² plot at auction, subsequently partnered with architects to develop the concept, and then recruited additional group members. This "initiator-led" approach represents an emerging hybrid between traditional developer-led projects and pure collective self-development (BBSR, 2009).

The project's timeline illustrates how professional support and clear leadership can accelerate the development process. Following the land purchase in September 2005, the initiators collaborated with architects to develop the design concept, established the planning company in July 2006, and completed group formation by January 2007. Through this process, the project expanded to include 15 participants aged 1-45 years, combining individuals seeking affordable housing with others interested in experimental building approaches (roedig.schop architekten, 2025).

K20's mixed-use program of nine residential and two commercial units reflects a sophisticated urban approach to collective self-development. The six-story building occupies a development gap in Kreutzigerstraße. The architectural design demonstrates a balance between individual customization and collective identity. Each floor contains approximately 180m² divided flexibly into two apartments (1/3 - 2/3 ratio), with all units organized around a central supply shaft that facilitates customized kitchen and bathroom configurations. The building achieves a generous 3.14m clear room height by foregoing an additional floor, matching the neighboring buildings while creating exceptional living spaces. Communal areas include a roof terrace with solar panels, sauna, multifunctional room, and shared garden, fostering community interaction while respecting private spatial domains (roedig.schop architekten, 2025).

At 16% lower cost for sqm than district's average, K20 achieved remarkable value despite its high energy and finishing standards. This success derives partly from the residents' direct involvement in construction management, with each member overseeing specific building trades and collectively designing the garden. The project maintained the typical three-stage legal evolution through Planning GbR, Building GbR, and finally homeowners' association, demonstrating how the standard *Baugruppen* framework can accommodate innovative initiation and management approaches (roedig.schop architekten, 2025).

### Summary: Adapting the Baugruppen Model to the Polish Context

The German Baugruppen model offers a promising approach for addressing Poland's housing challenges, but successful adaptation requires careful consideration of local conditions. The Baugruppen model's emphasis on individual ownership within a collective framework aligns well with Polish cultural preferences, where homeownership is strongly prioritized as a marker of life success while financial savings represent the primary motivation for considering alternative housing models.

Germany's case shows that municipal support is very beneficial but always required for implementation. However, given the track record of developing high quality, affordable housing, fostering long-term neighborhood community and developing in otherwise difficult locations, collective self-development might start to be seen favorably by Polish municipalities. Their assistance might begin with minimal models featuring single contact points within existing departments, gradually expanding as the concept gains traction. Land allocation policies would need particular attention, as access to appropriately zoned urban land represents a significant barrier in Poland's developer-dominated market. Performance-based reservation systems similar to Tübingen's six-month periods with extension options could provide a balanced approach that both supports building groups and protects municipal interests.

Professional facilitation would be essential but would need to be developed largely from scratch, as Poland lacks the established network of building group supervisors found in Germany. This represents both a challenge and an opportunity for creating a new professional field aligned with local needs.

The initiator-led approach demonstrated by K20 may prove especially relevant for Poland, as collective self-development concept remains unfamiliar to most potential participants. Architects, forward-thinking municipalities, or entrepreneurial individuals could serve as catalysts, acquiring land or options and then recruiting participants around a developed concept. This approach reduces initial uncertainty for participants while maintaining the core benefits of collective self-development. Medium-sized projects of 9-15 units would represent an ideal starting point, balancing the efficiencies of collective action with manageable group dynamics for this novel approach.

Rebranding represents a final critical consideration for Polish implementation. As cooperatism researchers noted, housing cooperatives in Poland carry the stigma of the socialist era, despite their core principle of collective action remaining valid (Corduroy de Lille, 2015; Skorupska, 2024). The Baugruppen model demonstrates how traditional cooperative housing concepts can be successfully reframed to appeal to a younger demographic. This rebranding approach, combined with targeted pilot projects demonstrating tangible benefits, could help overcome initial skepticism and establish collective self-development as a viable "third way" in Poland's housing market.

## Experimental initiatives in Poland

While collective self-development has historical roots dating to the nineteenth century in Poland, contemporary implementations emerged only in the 2010s through pioneering projects in Gdynia and Wrocław. The emergence of these projects coincides with growing recognition of what Skorupska (2024) identifies as the "rent gap"—a segment of the Polish population with incomes too high for state housing assistance yet insufficient for conventional market-rate housing acquisition.

Additional boost to the topic of collective self-development was given by the 'Ustawa o kooperatywa mieszkniowych' from 2022, which introduced a legal form for collective self-development.

Initiatives represent distinct approaches to collaborative housing that reflect Poland's unique socioeconomic context and cultural preferences, with the contemporary collective self-development landscape characterized by two contrasting implementation models that demonstrate the concept's adaptability to different institutional contexts.

The "Kooperatywa Pomorze" in Gdynia exemplifies a bottom-up, citizen-led approach developed entirely through grassroots initiative without governmental support. In contrast, "Kooperatywa Mieszkaniowa Nowe Żerniki" in Wrocław represents a municipality-supported model that demonstrates how institutional frameworks can facilitate collective self-development. 

### Kooperatywa Mieszkaniowa Nowe Żerniki

The Kooperatywa Mieszkaniowa Nowe Żerniki represents Poland's most direct adaptation of the German Baugruppen model, established within a broader urban development framework. Initiated in 2011 as part of a comprehensive greenfield project, this initiative explicitly drew inspiration from both contemporary German collaborative housing practices and Wrocław's own architectural heritage—specifically the 1929 WuWa exhibition (Wohnungs-und Werkraumausstellung) that showcased innovative housing solutions during the modernist period (Lis et al., 2022). This historical connection provided cultural legitimacy to what might otherwise have been perceived as a foreign housing concept, demonstrating how collaborative housing models can be effectively contextualized within local architectural traditions.

The Wrocław municipality played a decisive role in establishing this initiative through a multifaceted support framework. City officials undertook study visits to Berlin specifically to examine Baugruppen implementations, subsequently developing two proposal templates for joint project implementation agreements based on German experiences (Habitat for Humanity Poland, 2025). The municipality's commitment extended beyond knowledge transfer to include concrete policy interventions that addressed key implementation barriers. Most significantly, the city designated three plots in the heart of the Nowe Żerniki district specifically for housing cooperatives, offering them through perpetual usufruct arrangements that reduced land costs by approximately 80% compared to market sale prices (Lis et al., 2022). This intervention directly addressed what research has identified as the primary obstacle for collective self-development in Poland's developer-dominated urban land market.

The municipality further enhanced project viability through carefully designed selection criteria that balanced financial considerations with qualitative factors. The auction process for cooperative plots excluded commercial entities from participation and evaluated proposals based not only on price but also on conceptual quality, including floor plans, visualizations, and the design of common spaces. Additionally, the city established formal prerequisites for auction participation, requiring signed agreements on joint project implementation and detailed investment financing plans. Perhaps most crucially, municipal officials participated directly in negotiations with financial institutions, helping to legitimize the cooperative housing model and secure financing for participants when commercial banks proved reluctant (Habitat for Humanity Poland, 2025).

The Nowe Żerniki initiative has achieved notable success in translating the collaborative housing concept into completed projects while demonstrating the model's adaptability to evolving participant needs. The first cooperative building, formed by a group of ten friends who secured perpetual usufruct rights in early 2014, had already commenced construction by April 2015 (NGO PL Article, 2015). Subsequent tenders resulted in additional cooperative buildings, creating what Lis et al. (2022) describe as "an engaged civil society on a micro-scale" within just a few years. The completed projects feature common spaces including stroller storage, bicycle facilities, and community rooms, with additional service spaces such as dental offices, kindergartens, and cafés integrated into the development (Habitat for Humanity Poland, 2025).

Particularly noteworthy is the evolution of the model. Research by Lis et al. (2022) reveals that three buildings function close to the cohousing form, emphasizing ongoing community interaction and resource sharing, while one project transformed over time into a form of collective self-development more similar to the construction group model seen in Gdynia's Pomorze project. This diversity demonstrates the flexibility of collaborative housing approaches to accommodate different participant priorities and community dynamics. As one resident explained: "We started with approximately seventy-square-meter apartments, and ended up on average at one hundred meters," illustrating how the participatory design process allowed living spaces to evolve in response to changing family needs and financial circumstances (Lis et al., 2022).

Despite these successes, the Nowe Żerniki cooperative housing initiative encountered significant challenges that reveal systemic barriers to collaborative housing implementation in Poland. The most substantial obstacles emerged in the financing domain, where commercial banks demonstrated both conceptual resistance and practical limitations in accommodating collective borrowing arrangements. As one resident recounted, bank officials struggled with basic administrative procedures: "Sir, there are twelve people and I have only three boxes to enter the names" (Lis et al., 2022). This institutional inflexibility reflects broader issues of low public awareness and limited regulatory frameworks for collaborative housing in Poland.

Additional challenges emerged in the social dimension of cooperative living. Research by Lis et al. (2022) identified communication difficulties and conflict resolution as key concerns for potential residents. Some participants in the initial cooperative buildings subsequently placed their apartments for sale, suggesting integration difficulties within the established community. These experiences highlight the importance of developing appropriate governance structures and communication protocols for collaborative housing projects, particularly in a cultural context where such models remain unfamiliar.

The Nowe Żerniki cooperative housing initiative represents a significant milestone in Poland's exploration of alternative housing delivery models. By combining municipal support with resident participation, the project has created housing that achieves both affordability improvements and enhanced quality of life. Participants report cost reductions of 20-30% compared to conventional market options while gaining access to shared resources that would be unaffordable individually: "We have a large garden where we have a common trampoline... if five families chip in, then it's three hundred zlotys each, which is affordable" (Lis et al., 2022). The project demonstrates how institutional support can overcome implementation barriers while allowing for adaptation to local conditions and participant preferences. As Poland continues to grapple with housing affordability challenges, the Nowe Żerniki experience offers valuable insights into the potential and limitations of collaborative housing approaches in the Polish context.

### Kooperatywa Pomorze

Kooperatywa Pomorze emerged as the first collaborative self-development initiative in the country since World War II. Founded in 2012 in the Chwarzno-Wiczlino district of Gdynia, this grassroots housing cooperative was initiated by Roman Paczkowski, who drew inspiration from Scandinavian housing models (Sobolak, 2023). The project emerged in response to pressing housing affordability challenges, particularly for young families facing limited access to conventional housing markets. This analysis examines Kooperatywa Pomorze's development model, achievements, and limitations within the broader context of collaborative housing initiatives in Poland.

Unlike Nowe Żerniki in Wrocław, Kooperatywa Pomorze developed entirely through grassroots initiative without municipal or institutional support. The cooperative was formed by several families—both friends and strangers—who collectively managed the entire development process from land acquisition through design to construction completion. The cooperative's approach was characterized by a singular focus on cost reduction and individual ownership rather than community-building or shared facilities. This fundamental distinction positions it as a pure construction group within the collaborative housing typology (Rataj, 2023). As Paczkowski explains, "ownership is the basic idea and principle of a cooperative" (Sobolak, 2023). This pragmatic orientation stemmed from the founders' primary motivation: providing affordable housing for young families who could not access conventional market options.

Kooperatywa Pomorze's achievements extend beyond its initial implementation and the cooperative successfully completed four consecutive projects in Gdynia, providing housing for 36 families in total (Kutypa et al., 2018). The cost advantages proved substantial and consistent across implementations. According to Paczkowski, two Kooperatywa Pomorze projects achieved documented savings of 37% (Sobolak, 2023). These savings derive from eliminating developer profit margins and other overhead costs inherent in commercial development.

Perhaps most significantly, the cooperative model expanded housing access to previously excluded demographics. Paczkowski notes that "almost half of the participants did not have the ability to buy an apartment from a developer or on the secondary market, but had this ability when implementing their own cooperative" (Sobolak, 2023). This democratization of housing access represents a meaningful contribution to addressing Poland's "rent gap" (Skorupska, 2024). The success of Kooperatywa Pomorze catalyzed broader interest in the cooperative housing model throughout Poland. Information about the project spread via social media, attracting visitors from across the country seeking to replicate its approach. Moreover, Paczkowski, together with the Habitat Foundation, leveraged the cooperative's success to advocate for legislative recognition, ultimately contributing to the passage of the Housing Cooperatives Act in 2022.

Despite its achievements, Kooperatywa Pomorze faced significant challenges that highlight the limitations of its approach. Financing represented the most formidable obstacle, with major Polish banks initially reluctant to support the cooperative model despite accepting its business plan. As Paczkowski recounts, "Banks feared that when multiple investors focused on a single goal, misunderstandings could easily arise, threatening the implementation of the investment" (Sobolak, 2023). The cooperative eventually secured financing through a smaller cooperative bank after nearly two months of negotiations, illustrating the structural barriers facing alternative housing models in Poland's financial system.

The cooperative also encountered indifference from municipal authorities, receiving no support from local government in terms of land allocation, regulatory assistance, or infrastructure coordination. This lack of institutional engagement contrasts sharply with the Wrocław municipality's proactive approach to supporting housing cooperatives through land allocation, legal templates, and financing negotiations.

The cooperative's singular focus on cost reduction and individual ownership also produced certain disadvantages. Critics note that the cooperative's utilitarian approach resulted in limited architectural ambition (Kutypa et al., 2018). The projects utilized ready-made designs that did not include common spaces except for gardens accessible to all residents. This choice prioritized cost efficiency over architectural quality or contextual sensitivity and sacrificed opportunities community-building features that characterize more comprehensive collaborative housing models (Lis et al. 2022).

Kooperatywa Pomorze stands as a pioneering example of collective self-development, demonstrating both the potential and limitations of grassroots housing initiatives. The cooperative's achievement of substantial cost reductions, completion of multiple successful projects, and expansion of housing access to previously excluded demographics represents a significant contribution to addressing housing affordability challenges. However, the cooperative's experience also highlights the importance of institutional support, urban integration, and balanced priorities beyond cost reduction alone. Importantly, the challenges encountered by Kooperatywa Pomorze informed subsequent policy developments, including the 2022 Housing Cooperatives Act, which aims to provide a more supportive framework for future initiatives.

### Summary of pioneering CSD in Poland

The pioneering collective self-development initiatives in Poland—Kooperatywa Pomorze and Nowe Żerniki—demonstrate the model's adaptability while revealing contrasting implementation approaches. Despite their methodological differences, both projects delivered significant benefits that align with the theoretical advantages of collective self-development: cost reductions of 20-30% compared to conventional market options, enhanced design flexibility during planning, and the development of supportive social networks (Skorupska, 2024; Lis et al., 2022).

The implementation strategies, however, diverged substantially. Nowe Żerniki, benefiting from municipal support through land allocation and legal frameworks, emphasized community spaces and social integration within a comprehensive urban development framework. This institutional approach facilitated higher architectural quality and urban coherence but primarily served middle to upper-income demographics. In contrast, Kooperatywa Pomorze developed through purely grassroots initiative without institutional support, prioritizing cost minimization and individual ownership at the expense of common areas and urban integration. This utilitarian approach successfully expanded housing access to previously excluded demographics but sacrificed opportunities for community-building features that characterize more comprehensive collaborative housing models (Lis et al., 2022).

These contrasting approaches highlight flexibility as a fundamental advantage of collective self-development in addressing Poland's housing challenges. The ideal implementation would combine Pomorze's grassroots affordability with Nowe Żerniki's institutional framework and architectural quality—balancing economic accessibility with community integration and urban coherence. These pioneering projects offer complementary insights for developing a "third way" between developer-built and individual self-build housing that responds to the country's specific cultural and economic context.
