## Housing affordability crisis

Rising living costs represent the primary concern for residents across developed nations (Ipsos, 2025). In Europe, housing affordability emerged as a particularly critical challenge as the housing market has experienced price growth that significantly outpaces general inflation. Between 2015 and 2023, residential property prices increased by an average of 48% across the European Union, whereas in Poland by 79.8% (Eurostat, 2023). The political importance of this issue is evident in voting patterns, as housing affordability became the leading motivation for voter participation in the 2024 European elections (Eurobarometer, 2024).

This exceptional price growth results from multiple factors affecting both market supply and demand. On the supply side, construction activity faces limitations from increasing building material costs and persistent labor shortages. On the demand side, the housing market has transformed as properties increasingly serve as investment vehicles rather than primarily as homes. High interest rates have further complicated this situation by raising financing costs for middle-income buyers seeking to purchase homes (Eurostat, 2023).

Poland presents a particularly instructive case of these affordability challenges. Research by the European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion (ESPON) has identified a distinctive pattern in Poland's housing market. While most European countries show right-skewed housing price distributions—meaning lower-priced housing predominates—Poland exhibits an approximately normal distribution. This pattern, when considered alongside Poland's income distribution (where median income falls substantially below average income), reveals a structural mismatch between housing supply and affordability needs (Statistics Poland, 2024).

The affordability problem becomes most severe for families seeking appropriately sized housing. When examining the financial requirements for a 100m² unit—a size typically needed by families—Poland ranks among the European Union's least accessible housing markets. Many regions require more than one person's complete income for renting such units or demand over 35 years of dedicating 40% of annual income for purchase (ESPON, 2024). Lack of adequate housing is shown as a major factor in driving suburbanization as young families cannot find

## Structure of housing supply

Poland's construction sector has achieved remarkable output levels. Between 2016 and 2021, the sector delivered more new dwellings than the entire housing stock of Warsaw (Lis et al. 2023). However, this impressive quantity masks a concerning lack of diversity in housing delivery methods. The market is highly concentrated, with real estate developers and individual investors accounting for nearly all new housing stock. In 2024, of 199,931 new housing units, 62% came from developers, 35% from individual investors, and only 3% from housing cooperatives and other non-market actors (Statistics Poland, 2025).

This market structure presents prospective homeowners with a binary choice: developer-built units or self-build single-family houses. These options represent fundamentally different approaches to housing development, each with distinct characteristics and trade-offs.

Developer-built housing dominates the multi-family sector. Real estate developers manage the entire development process from land acquisition through construction to sales, focusing on risk management, feasibility analysis, and market alignment (Graaskamp, 1992). Operating as risk-minimizing enterprises, they prioritize standardized designs and mainstream market segments, typically delivering either multi-family buildings with investor-friendly smaller units or standardized single-family houses (BBSR, 2009).

The developer model offers several advantages, particularly in terms of scale and efficiency. These firms undertake large-scale projects to offset fixed costs, operating almost exclusively in urban and suburban areas with appropriate zoning. They provide buyers with a hands-off experience and regulatory protections. But this convenience comes at a cost—the developer-built housing includes significant profit margins (20-30%) and prioritizes short-term returns over long-term operating expenditure (National Bank of Poland, 2024).

At the other end of the spectrum, self-build housing represents an entirely different approach. Individual investors directly manage their development, typically creating single-family houses or duplexes in rural or suburban locations. While self-builders assume full financial and project management risk, they gain complete control over design and customization. This approach eliminates developer margins but requires significant personal involvement and expertise in construction management.

This stark contrast in development approaches has created pronounced market segmentation. Developers dominate urban areas with large-scale, standardized projects, while individual self-builders operate primarily in rural or suburban locations with available smaller plots.

## Collective self-development as an alternative

One promising approach to bridging this market gap is collaborative housing, an umbrella term encompassing various forms of resident-led development. At its core, collaborative housing involves significant coordination between future residents and other stakeholders throughout the development process, with residents actively participating in planning, design, and sometimes construction while maintaining individual autonomy in their living spaces (Czischke et al., 2021).

While diverse forms of collaborative housing have gained traction across Europe, implementing such models in Poland requires careful consideration of the local context. Research indicates that collaborative housing faces several cultural and practical barriers in Poland. Young Poles strongly prioritize individual homeownership, viewing it as a marker of life success, and generally resist shared living arrangements. Financial savings emerge as the primary motivation, while concerns about lengthy development processes, limited space, and shared ownership structures act as significant deterrents (Lis et al., 2023).

Given these cultural preferences and constraints, this thesis focuses specifically on collective self-development as the most promising collaborative housing model for the Polish market. This approach maintains individual ownership—aligning with local preferences—while leveraging the benefits of group coordination.

The following table illustrates how collective self-development positions itself as a "third way" between traditional developer-built and individual self-build housing:

| Characteristic | Developer-built Housing | Collective Self-development | Self-build Housing |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Scale | Large developments | Medium-sized projects (10-20 units) | Single units or duplexes |
| Location | Urban and suburban areas with existing zoning | Urban and semi-urban areas with municipal support | Rural and suburban areas, including agricultural land |
| Project Risk | Assumed by developer; buyer protected by regulations | Shared among group members; partially mitigated by collective approach | Fully assumed by the owner-builder |
| Economies of Scale | Significant cost advantages in materials and labor | Moderate economies of scale through collective purchasing | None; each project unique |
| Customization | Limited; standardized designs | Balanced; individual units within collective framework | Full customization possible |
| Buyer Involvement | Minimal; turnkey solution | Moderate to high; shared decision-making process | Extensive; manages entire process |
| Cost Structure | Includes 20-30% developer margin | No developer margin; shared overhead costs | No developer margin; direct costs only |
| Time Horizon | Short-term focus; limited post-sale involvement | Medium to long-term; emphasis on community building | Long-term perspective on maintenance and operations |
| Target Market | Investment-oriented buyers, first-time homeowners seeking convenience | Urban middle-class families seeking affordability and community | Families seeking customization and cost control |

# State of the art
Collective self-development represents a significant innovation in housing delivery systems that has emerged across various global contexts (Palmer, 2020; Barenstein & Pfister, 2019). To better understand the potential and challenges of implementing collective self-development in Poland, we can examine the mature German *Baugruppen* model alongside emerging Polish initiatives.

## German Baugruppen model

Germany's *Baugruppen* (building groups) model stands as a particularly instructive case study that has evolved from experimental beginnings to achieve substantial market presence. *Baugruppen* are groups of people that participate in the planning, design, and sometimes construction of multi-unit housing projects while maintaining individual ownership of their units. The model adapts Germany's earlier *Genossenschaften* (cooperative) tradition for contemporary contexts. Beginning as isolated projects among friend networks in the 1970s, *Baugruppen* gained momentum in the mid-1990s through systematic implementation in Tübingen and Freiburg's urban conversion areas. This evolution from marginal experiment to established practice has resulted in the model now accounting for approximately 15-17% of new housing production in Germany, demonstrating its viability at meaningful scale (Tummers, 2015; BBSR, 2009).

The *Baugruppen* approach addresses three fundamental housing policy challenges through its distinctive development methodology. First, it achieves substantial affordability improvements through the elimination of developer profit margins and the leveraging of collective negotiation power for financing and materials procurement. Second, the model fosters social cohesion by establishing neighborhood bonds during the early planning phase; these connections frequently evolve into enduring support networks that enhance residential satisfaction. Third, it enables housing quality by facilitating direct collaboration between residents and architects, thereby prioritizing sustainable materials and ecological considerations that are frequently subordinated in profit-oriented development (BBSR, 2009).

*Baugruppen* initiatives are often supported by German municipalities, which have developed institutional frameworks to facilitate the development process. Cities such as Freiburg, Berlin, Tübingen, and Hamburg have implemented comprehensive programs that combine direct promotion, public-private partnerships, and targeted incentives (Hamiduddin & Gallent, 2016). These typically encompass land allocation through six-month reservation periods with performance-based extensions; infrastructure support through meeting spaces and dedicated municipal contact persons; and public engagement through coordinated information campaigns (Droste, 2015).

The efficacy of the *Baugruppen* model derives substantially from professional facilitation and procedural clarity. With expert architectural and supervisory support, projects typically progress from initial meeting to construction commencement in 6-9 months, contrasting sharply with the 5-7 year timeline often experienced without professional guidance. This efficiency stems from a clearly articulated four-phase development process:

1. The Interest Community phase concentrates on group formation and site selection
2. The Planning Community phase establishes a civil law partnership and develops detailed architectural plans
3. The Building Community phase manages construction execution and project accounting
4. The Owner Community phase transitions the group into a legal community under the german law (BBSR, 2009)

Empirical research demonstrates that *Baugruppen* projects consistently deliver several advantages over conventional development approaches. The model facilitates stronger neighborly relationships while providing customized architectural solutions that reflect specific household requirements (Droste, 2015). Significantly, building groups often succeed in challenging locations rejected by traditional developers, creating high-quality developments in previously undervalued areas. Their projects demonstrate stronger orientation toward demand satisfaction and quality optimization than developer-led initiatives, thereby contributing to sustainable housing markets through long-term resident commitment and community-based initiatives (BBSR, 2009).

Nevertheless, the german model presents notable challenges. Practical difficulties include construction delays, financial uncertainties, and cost escalations resulting from member turnover. The mutual dependence between group members can lead to demanding deliberative processes and extended decision-making timelines (Seeman, 2019). Moreover, while collective self-development effectively serves middle-class households, its capacity to accommodate economically disadvantaged groups remains limited due to the required financial commitments and substantial personal involvement in the development process (Droste, 2015).

To showcase how these advantages and challenges manifest in practice, we can examine two contrasting *Baugruppen* projects that illustrate different approaches to implementation:

### Building Community "Südlicht" in Berlin-Pankow

The Südlicht project in Berlin-Pankow exemplifies the *Baugruppen* model's adaptation to established urban contexts. Initiated in 2006, this medium-scale development demonstrates the model's capacity to create high-quality housing in established urban neighborhoods. The project served as a pioneering development in the larger transformation of the Eschengraben area, subsequently inspiring several neighboring *Baugruppen* initiatives (Baugemeinschaft Eschengarten, 2025).

The project's scale and methodological approach align with typical *Baugruppen* characteristics. Planned for nine residential units on a 940m² plot, it represents an optimal balance between the efficiencies of collective development and the manageability of group decision-making processes. The development follows the standard four-phase process, with professional facilitation from AREA agency, which moderated monthly group meetings, assisted in recruiting new building families when necessary, and supported the selection of project partners including architects and building services engineers. Within a year, the project had secured a land option, established its planning company (Planungs-GbR), and reserved approximately half of its units.

Südlicht's legal structure illustrates the model's approach to risk management and community building. The three-stage evolution—from Planning GbR through Building GbR to final homeowners' association—provides a framework that balances collective action during development with individual ownership rights after completion. This structure addressed initial participant concerns regarding project risks, as articulated by resident Andrea Reichert-Clauß: "We were skeptical at first... after all, building yourself is complex. You feel at the mercy of so many coincidences." The professional support structure mitigated these concerns through procedural clarity and expert guidance (Baugemeinschaft Eschengarten, 2025).

The project's demographic composition reflects the model's appeal to urban middle-class families. Most future residents originated from the central Prenzlauer Berg district, seeking to maintain their urban lifestyle while gaining access to more family-friendly housing. The location offered an ideal balance: a quiet residential street at the border between Prenzlauer Berg and Pankow, providing both tranquility and bicycle-distance access to their former neighborhood. This strategic site selection reinforced the model's community-building aspects, as residents shared both physical proximity to their previous neighborhood and similar lifestyle preferences.

The communal garden, accessible to all residents, provides secure play areas for children and functions as a focal point for community interaction. As Reichert-Clauß observes, "The social and communicative aspects of a building group were especially important to us... Usually, a house community develops only after years of living together. For us, it happened even before moving in" (Baugemeinschaft Eschengarten, 2025).

 The project achieved competitive pricing for its location and quality level, illustrating the model's capacity to deliver value through collective action. This price point reflects the cost advantages of eliminated developer margins while accommodating high-quality materials and individual unit customization, demonstrating the balance between affordability and quality that characterizes successful *Baugruppen* developments.

### Building Group K20 in Berlin-Friedrichshain

The K20 project in Berlin-Friedrichshain presents an innovative variation on the traditional *Baugruppen* approach, demonstrating the model's flexibility in project initiation and group formation. Unlike Südlicht's more conventional group-led approach, K20 originated when two private individuals purchased a 693m² plot at auction, subsequently partnered with architects to develop the concept, and then recruited additional group members. This "initiator-led" approach represents an emerging hybrid between traditional developer-led projects and pure collective self-development (BBSR, 2009).

The project's timeline illustrates how professional support and clear leadership can accelerate the development process. Following the land purchase in September 2005, the initiators collaborated with architects to develop the design concept, established the planning company in July 2006, and completed group formation by January 2007. Through this process, the project expanded to include 15 participants aged 1-45 years, combining individuals seeking affordable housing with others interested in experimental building approaches (roedig.schop architekten, 2025).

K20's mixed-use program of nine residential and two commercial units reflects a sophisticated urban approach to collective self-development. The six-story building occupies a development gap in Kreutzigerstraße. The architectural design demonstrates a balance between individual customization and collective identity. Each floor contains approximately 180m² divided flexibly into two apartments (1/3 - 2/3 ratio), with all units organized around a central supply shaft that facilitates customized kitchen and bathroom configurations. The building achieves a generous 3.14m clear room height by foregoing an additional floor, matching the neighboring buildings while creating exceptional living spaces. Communal areas include a roof terrace with solar panels, sauna, multifunctional room, and shared garden, fostering community interaction while respecting private spatial domains (roedig.schop architekten, 2025).

At 16% lower cost for sqm than district's average, K20 achieved remarkable value despite its high energy and finishing standards. This success derives partly from the residents' direct involvement in construction management, with each member overseeing specific building trades and collectively designing the garden. The project maintained the typical three-stage legal evolution through Planning GbR, Building GbR, and finally homeowners' association, demonstrating how the standard *Baugruppen* framework can accommodate innovative initiation and management approaches (roedig.schop architekten, 2025).

### Summary: Adapting the Baugruppen Model to the Polish Context

The German Baugruppen model offers a promising approach for addressing Poland's housing challenges, but successful adaptation requires careful consideration of local conditions. The Baugruppen model's emphasis on individual ownership within a collective framework aligns well with Polish cultural preferences, where homeownership is strongly prioritized as a marker of life success while financial savings represent the primary motivation for considering alternative housing models.

Germany's case shows that municipal support is very beneficial but always required for implementation. However, given the track record of developing high quality, affordable housing, fostering long-term neighborhood community and developing in otherwise difficult locations, collective self-development might start to be seen favorably by Polish municipalities. Their assistance might begin with minimal models featuring single contact points within existing departments, gradually expanding as the concept gains traction. Land allocation policies would need particular attention, as access to appropriately zoned urban land represents a significant barrier in Poland's developer-dominated market. Performance-based reservation systems similar to Tübingen's six-month periods with extension options could provide a balanced approach that both supports building groups and protects municipal interests.

Professional facilitation would be essential but would need to be developed largely from scratch, as Poland lacks the established network of building group supervisors found in Germany. This represents both a challenge and an opportunity for creating a new professional field aligned with local needs.

The initiator-led approach demonstrated by K20 may prove especially relevant for Poland, as collective self-development concept remains unfamiliar to most potential participants. Architects, forward-thinking municipalities, or entrepreneurial individuals could serve as catalysts, acquiring land or options and then recruiting participants around a developed concept. This approach reduces initial uncertainty for participants while maintaining the core benefits of collective self-development. Medium-sized projects of 9-15 units would represent an ideal starting point, balancing the efficiencies of collective action with manageable group dynamics for this novel approach.

Rebranding represents a final critical consideration for Polish implementation. As Corduroy De Lille (2015) notes, housing cooperatives in Poland carry the stigma of the socialist era, despite their core principle of collective action remaining valid. The Baugruppen model demonstrates how traditional cooperative housing concepts can be successfully reframed to appeal to a younger demographic. This rebranding approach, combined with targeted pilot projects demonstrating tangible benefits, could help overcome initial skepticism and establish collective self-development as a viable "third way" in Poland's housing market.
