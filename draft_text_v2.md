## Housing affordability crisis

Rising costs of living are currently the number one source of concern for much of the developed world (Ipsos, 2025). In Europe, housing costs have experienced a disproportionate increase relative to general inflation. Between 2015 and 2023, residential property prices increased on average by 48%, with particularly strong growth in Central and Eastern Europe, notably Hungary (+172.5%), Lithuania (+114.2%), and Poland (+79.8%) (Eurostat, 2023). The significance of this issue is reflected in electoral behavior, as housing affordability constituted the primary motivation for voter participation in the 2024 European elections (Eurobarometer, 2024).

This unprecedented price growth stems from multiple factors affecting both supply and demand sides of the market. On the supply side, construction faces challenges from rising building material prices and persistent labor shortages. The demand side has been transformed by the increasing role of properties as investment vehicles. Additionally, high interest rates have significantly increased the cost of financing home purchases for middle-income buyers (Eurostat, 2023).

The situation in Poland presents a particularly concerning case. Recent research by the European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion (ESPON) reveals a unique pattern in the country's housing market. While other European nations typically exhibit right-skewed housing price distributions - indicating a predominance of lower-priced housing - Poland shows an approximately normal distribution. When considered alongside the country's income distribution, where the median is substantially lower than the mean, this pattern indicates a severe mismatch between housing supply and affordability needs (Statistics Poland, 2024).

This national-level challenge manifests differently across regions. In the rental market, most Polish regions allow households to rent only 30-50 m² of living space when allocating 40% of monthly income, ranking among the least affordable in the European Union. This rental market constraint pushes many households toward homeownership, where affordability varies dramatically by region. In the least affordable regions, households can purchase only 25-50 m² with 40% of their 10-year income, while in the most affordable regions, this increases to 175-200 m².

The affordability crisis is particularly acute in the market for larger dwellings. When examining the financial requirements for a 100m² unit - a size typically sought by families - Poland emerges as one of the European Union's least affordable housing markets. Many regions require more than one person's income for renting or over 35 years of dedicating 40% of annual income for purchase (ESPON, 2024). These findings underscore the urgent need for innovative solutions to Poland's housing challenges.

## Structure of housing supply

Despite these affordability challenges, Poland's construction sector has achieved remarkable output levels. Between 2016 and 2021, the sector delivered more new dwellings than the entire housing stock of Warsaw (Lis et al. 2023). However, this impressive quantity masks a concerning lack of diversity in housing delivery methods. The market is highly concentrated, with real estate developers and individual investors accounting for nearly all new housing stock. In 2024, of 199,931 new housing units, 62% came from developers, 35% from individual investors, and only 3% from housing cooperatives and other non-market actors. Moreover, the developer-built share has steadily increased since Poland's transition to a market economy in the 1990s (Statistics Poland, 2025).

This market structure presents prospective homeowners with a binary choice: developer-built units or self-build single-family houses. These options represent fundamentally different approaches to housing development, each with distinct characteristics and trade-offs.

Developer-built housing dominates the multi-family sector. Real estate developers, as specialized entities, manage the entire development process from land acquisition through construction to sales. Their business model focuses on risk management, feasibility analysis, and alignment with market demands (Graaskamp, 1992). Operating as risk-minimizing enterprises, they prioritize standardized designs and mainstream market segments, typically delivering either multi-family buildings with investor-friendly smaller units or standardized single-family houses.

The developer model offers several advantages, particularly in terms of scale and efficiency. These firms undertake large-scale projects to offset fixed costs, operating almost exclusively in urban and suburban areas with appropriate zoning. They provide buyers with a hands-off experience and regulatory protections, but this convenience comes at a cost. The approach includes significant profit margins (20-30%) and prioritizes short-term returns over long-term property considerations (National Bank of Poland, 2024).

At the other end of the spectrum, self-build housing represents an entirely different approach. Individual investors directly manage their housing development, typically creating single-family houses or duplexes in rural or suburban locations. While self-builders assume full financial and project management risk, they gain complete control over design and customization. This approach eliminates developer margins but requires significant personal involvement and expertise in construction management.

This stark contrast in development approaches has led to pronounced market segmentation. Developers dominate urban areas with large-scale, standardized projects, while individual self-builders operate primarily in rural or suburban locations with available single plots. The result is a significant gap in the middle of the market: there are few options for those seeking the efficiency of collective development while maintaining a degree of customization, or for those interested in medium-scale projects in semi-urban locations. This market gap suggests an opportunity for alternative development models that could bridge these extremes.

## Group-build as an alternative

One promising approach to bridging this market gap is collaborative housing, an umbrella term encompassing various forms of resident-led development. At its core, collaborative housing involves significant coordination between future residents and other stakeholders throughout the development process, with residents actively participating in planning, design, and sometimes construction while maintaining individual autonomy in their living spaces (Czischke, 2020).

While diverse forms of collaborative housing have gained traction across Europe - ranging from close-knit co-living communities to temporary cost-sharing arrangements (Czischke et al., 2021) - implementing such models in Poland requires careful consideration of the local context. Research indicates that collaborative housing faces several cultural and practical barriers in Poland. Young Poles strongly prioritize individual homeownership, viewing it as a marker of life success, and generally resist shared living arrangements. However, those already comfortable with resource sharing are five times more likely to consider collaborative approaches. Financial savings emerge as the primary motivation, while concerns about lengthy development processes, limited space, and shared ownership structures act as significant deterrents (Lis et al., 2023).

Given these cultural preferences and constraints, this thesis focuses specifically on collective self-development as the most promising collaborative housing model for the Polish market. This approach maintains individual ownership - aligning with local preferences - while leveraging the benefits of group coordination.

The following table illustrates how collective self-development positions itself as a "third way" between traditional developer-built and individual self-build housing:

| Characteristic | Developer-built Housing | Collective Self-development | Self-build Housing |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Scale | Large developments | Medium-sized projects (10-50 units) | Single units or duplexes |
| Location | Urban and suburban areas with existing zoning | Urban and semi-urban areas with municipal support | Rural and suburban areas, including agricultural land |
| Project Risk | Assumed by developer; buyer protected by regulations | Shared among group members; partially mitigated by collective approach | Fully assumed by the owner-builder |
| Economies of Scale | Significant cost advantages in materials and labor | Moderate economies of scale through collective purchasing | None; each project unique |
| Customization | Limited; standardized designs | Balanced; individual units within collective framework | Full customization possible |
| Buyer Involvement | Minimal; turnkey solution | Moderate to high; shared decision-making process | Extensive; manages entire process |
| Cost Structure | Includes 20-30% developer margin | No developer margin; shared overhead costs | No developer margin; direct costs only |
| Time Horizon | Short-term focus; limited post-sale involvement | Medium to long-term; emphasis on community building | Long-term perspective on maintenance and operations |
| Target Market | Investment-oriented buyers, first-time homeowners seeking convenience | Urban middle-class families seeking affordability and community | Families seeking customization and cost control |

This comparative analysis demonstrates how collective self-development could fill the current gap in Poland's housing market, offering a middle ground that combines the advantages of both established approaches while addressing their respective limitations.

# State of the art
To better understand the potential and challenges of implementing collective self-development in Poland, we can examine the mature German *Baugruppen* model alongside emerging Polish initiatives.

## German Baugruppen model

While collective self-development exists in various forms worldwide (Palmer, 2020; Barenstein & Pfister 2019), Germany's *Baugruppen* (building groups) model stands out as a particularly successful alternative to traditional housing development. The model evolved from the country's earlier *Genossenschaften* (cooperative) tradition but represents a significant innovation in housing delivery. Today, *Baugruppen* account for approximately 15-17% of new housing in Germany, demonstrating the model's viability at scale (Tummers, 2015).

*Baugruppen* addresses three key housing policy challenges:
1. Affordability - through elimination of developer margins and economies of scale compared to individual self-build
2. Social cohesion - by fostering interaction during the development process
3. Housing quality - enabling customization to meet specific household needs

German municipalities play a crucial role in facilitating *Baugruppen* through various support mechanisms. Cities like Freiburg, Berlin, Tübingen, and Hamburg have developed comprehensive approaches combining direct promotion, public-private partnerships, and incentives for private investors(Hamiduddin & Gallent, 2016). The support ranges from providing serviced plots at fixed prices and offering construction subsidies to guaranteeing seed capital loans for groups meeting social housing criteria (Droste, 2015)

Research indicates that *Baugruppen* offer several distinct advantages over traditional homeownership paths. The model enables stronger neighborly relationships and support networks while allowing for customized architectural solutions that reflect individual needs. Perhaps most significantly, its cost-effectiveness makes urban homeownership accessible to middle-class families who might otherwise be priced out of city centers. These benefits are achieved with limited demands on municipal governance and resources, potentially contributing to neighborhood sustainability (Seeman, 2019).

However, the model also presents notable challenges. Practical difficulties include construction delays, financial risks, and cost escalations due to member turnover. The mutual dependence between group members can lead to demanding debates and extended decision-making processes (Seeman, 2019). Moreover, while *Baugruppen* can effectively serve middle-class households, their capacity to house economically disadvantaged groups remains limited (Droste, 2015). These limitations, combined with the requirement for significant personal involvement and dependence on municipal land allocation, help explain why the model, despite its advantages, remains relatively modest in scale.

The German experience offers valuable insights for implementing collective self-development in Poland. Perhaps most significantly, *Baugruppen* demonstrates how rebranding traditional cooperative housing can appeal to a new generation - just as it transformed the perception of *Genossenschaften* from an outdated model to an attractive contemporary choice. This is particularly relevant in Poland, where housing cooperatives carry the stigma of the socialist era, yet their core principle of collective action remains valid (Corduroy De Lille, 2015).

Furthermore, the German model shows that successful collective self-development does not necessarily require extensive public spending, but rather a supportive regulatory environment. This approach aligns well with the preferences of young, urban, and relatively affluent Poles who value individual ownership but might be open to collaborative approaches if they offer clear benefits. The *Baugruppen* model's trade-off - achieving high-quality, customized housing and strong community bonds at the cost of accepting greater personal involvement and some financial risk - could resonate with this demographic, particularly given Poland's challenging housing affordability situation.
