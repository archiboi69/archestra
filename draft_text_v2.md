## Housing affordability crisis

Rising costs of living are currently the number one source of concern for much of the developed world (Ipsos, 2025). In Europe, housing costs have experienced a disproportionate increase relative to general inflation. Between 2015 and 2023, residential property prices increased on average by 48%, with particularly strong growth in Central and Eastern European countries, notably Hungary (+172.5%), Lithuania (+114.2%), and Poland (+79.8%) (Eurostat, 2023). The significance of this issue is reflected in electoral behavior, as housing affordability constituted the primary motivation for voter participation in the 2024 European elections, prompting the establishment of a dedicated housing commissioner (Eurobarometer, 2024).

The reasons contributing to the increase were both on the supply side - higher building material prices, labor shortages, as well as on the demand side - the rise in using properties as an investment vehicle. Moreover high interest rates increased the cost of financing home purchases (Eurostat, 2023).

In Poland, the situation is particularly. In an ongoing study, European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion (ESPON), used housing market prices and incomes to compute regional affordability indicators (ESPON, 2024). Their findings reveal that while all other European countries exhibit a right-skewed housing price distributions - indicating a larger share of lower-priced housing - Poland uniquely demonstrates an approximately normal distribution. Considering the distribution of income in national economy - median income is much lower than the mean, there is a severe mismatch between the supply and demand for affordable housing (Statistics Poland, 2024).

At the subnational level, the situation is more diverse. On the rental market, the majority of Polish regions permit households to rent only 30-50 m² of living space when allocating 40% of monthly income, ranking among the least affordable in the European Union. This pushes people to buying market, where the situation is dependent on the region. Households in the least affordable regions are able to purchase between 25 and 50 m² with 40% of their 10 years’ income while in the most affordable regions between 175 to 200 m².

A particularly challenging situation is in the market for larger dwellings. The study looked also at the percentage of monthly income to rent and number of years spending 40% of annual income to assume buying a 100m² unit. In these terms, Poland is shown to be one of the least affordable countries in the European Union, with many regions needing more than 1 person's income to rent, or more then 35 years to buy a larger dwelling (ESPON, 2024).

## Structure of housing supply

Polish construction sector is adding record numbers of new dwellings - between 2016 and 2021 more new dwellings were built in Poland than the entire housing stock of Warsaw (Lis et al. 2023). At the same time, the supply of housing is very concentrated, with real-estate developers and individual investors responsible for almost all of the new housing stock. In 2024, 199,931 new housing units were built, out of which 62% were delivered by developers, 35% by individual investors, 1% by housing cooperatives and 2% by others, mostly non-market actors. Moreover, the share of developer-built housing is steadily increasing since the transformation to market economy in the 1990s (Statistics Poland, 2025).

As such, for new housing in Poland, prospective homeowners face a binary choice: self-build single-family houses or developer-built units. These options represent contrasting approaches to both development methodology and housing outcomes.

A real estate developer is an entity that specializes in creating and managing buildings or land, to meet the needs of consumers. Their role involves risk management, feasibility analysis, and aligning the project with market demands and community goals (Graaskamp, 1992).

Operating as risk-minimizing enterprises, developers prioritize standardized designs and mainstream market segments. In Poland, they focus on multi-family buildings with smaller units that appeal to investors, or standardized single-family houses in larger developments.

Developers typically undertake large-scale projects to offset fixed costs, almost exclusively operating in urban and suburban areas with appropriate zoning. They manage the entire development process, offering buyers a hands-off experience but limited customization options. While this approach minimizes buyer risk through regulatory protections, it includes a significant profit margin (20-30%) and prioritizes short-term returns over long-term property considerations (National Bank of Poland, 2024).

Self-build represents the opposite approach, where individual investors directly manage their housing development. These projects typically involve single-family houses or duplexes, often in rural or suburban locations. While self-builders assume full financial risk, they gain complete control over design and customization. The process requires significant personal involvement but eliminates developer margins and emphasizes long-term maintenance considerations.


| Characteristic | Developer-built Housing | Self-build Housing |
|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Scale | Large developments | Single units or duplexes |
| Location | Urban and suburban areas with existing zoning | Rural and suburban areas, including agricultural land |
| Project Risk | Assumed by developer; buyer protected by regulations | Fully assumed by the owner-builder |
| Economies of Scale | Significant cost advantages in materials and labor | None; each project unique |
| Customization | Limited; standardized designs | Full customization possible |
| Buyer Involvement | Minimal; turnkey solution | Extensive; manages entire process |
| Cost Structure | Includes 20-30% developer margin | No developer margin; direct costs only |
| Time Horizon | Short-term focus; limited post-sale involvement | Long-term perspective on maintenance and operations |
| Target Market | Investment-oriented buyers, first-time homeowners seeking convenience | Families seeking customization and cost control |


## Group-build as an alternative

This stark contrast in development approaches not only reflects different housing needs but also results in a pronounced market segmentation. Developers focus on large-scale projects in urban areas, primarily delivering apartment buildings or standardized housing developments that maximize returns. Meanwhile, individual investors operate in entirely different territories - typically rural or suburban areas with available single plots - creating highly customized single-family homes. These two approaches occupy opposite ends of the housing market spectrum, effectively leaving a significant gap in the middle: there are few options for those seeking the efficiency of collective development while maintaining a degree of customization, or for those interested in medium-scale projects in semi-urban locations. This market gap suggests an opportunity for alternative development models, particularly collaborative housing.

Collaborative housing encompasses various housing forms characterized by significant coordination between future residents and other stakeholders throughout the development process. At its core, it involves residents actively participating in the planning, design, and sometimes construction of their housing project, working together toward shared goals while maintaining individual autonomy in their living spaces (Czischke, 2020).

Diverse forms of collaborative housing has seen adoption in Western Europe, ranging from co-living in a closely knit community to temporary arrangements for sharing construction costs (Czischke et al., 2021). However, when thinking about collaborative housing in Poland it is critical to consider the local context. Recent research indicates that collaborative housing remains a niche solution, with several cultural and practical barriers limiting its adoption. Young Poles strongly prefer individual homeownership, viewing it as a marker of life success, and are generally reluctant to engage in shared living arrangements. The exception appears among those already predisposed to sharing resources, who are five times more likely to consider collaborative housing. The primary motivation for considering such arrangements is financial savings, while concerns about lengthy development processes, limited space, and shared ownership structures act as significant deterrents (Lis et al., 2023). This traditional attitude toward homeownership, combined with low social capital and limited public awareness, creates distinct challenges for collaborative housing initiatives in Poland.

Given these various forms of collaborative housing and considering the Polish context - where individual ownership is highly valued and shared living arrangements face cultural resistance - this paper focuses specifically on collective self-development. This model represents the most promising approach for the Polish market as it maintains individual ownership while leveraging the benefits of group coordination. 

In this context, collective self-development refers to a process where future homeowners pool their resources to jointly develop their housing, collaborating primarily during the planning and construction phases while maintaining full individual ownership of their units (Czischke et al., 2021). This approach combines the cost advantages of collective action with the cultural preference for private ownership, potentially offering a viable middle ground between developer-built and individual self-build housing. It is however, important to note that even if the primary motivation for considering collective self-development is financial savings, the model also offers a unique opportunity to create a sense of community and shared ownership (Hamiduddin & Gallent, 2016).

# State of the art

While collective self-development initiatives can be found across Europe, Germany's Baugruppen (building groups) model stands as a particularly successful example, having evolved into a well-established alternative to traditional housing development. By examining this mature system alongside emerging Polish initiatives, we can better understand both the potential and challenges of implementing collective self-development in the Polish context.
