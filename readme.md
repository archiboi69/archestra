`jaki jest cel tego dyplomu dla mnie?`

I became an architect because I want to create the best built environment possible. To achieve this most efficiently, I must run a sustainable and profitable architectural business. This thesis will lay the groundwork for a successful architectural practice.

# Part I: Theory

## Aim

This thesis aims to establish a lean and sustainable business model for sole-proprietor architectural practices by automating or outsourcing labor-intensive tasks. The goal is to enable these firms to improve service quality and remain competitive on the evolving market.

### The business of architecture

Architecture firms are small and medium enterprises that provide professional architectural services. The core of these services involves translating client needs and regulatory requirements into functional, aesthetic, and durable designs. To deliver these services, a firm usually employs architects who collaborate to create design solutions (Scharphie, 2014).

Most practices have a simple business model that converts a fee agreed in the contract to time billed to the project, with leftover sum forming the operating profit on net revenue (Bernstein, 2018). To ensure continued business and manage risk, firms need to increase their output to take on larger and more numerous projects. To achieve it, they typically hire more architects and boost their productivity through investments in design tools (Celiński, 2024). As such, the revenue is tied to employment and for a given productivity level, the more architects work for a firm the greater its revenue (ACE, 2022).

Revenues per practice size in selected European markets:

| Country | 1 staff | 2 staff | 3-5 staff | 6-10 staff | 11-30 staff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Poland | €25,256 | €33,128 | €208,145 | €144,394 | €387,454 |
| Portugal | €24,416 | €46,214 | €134,954 | €260,457 | €1,223,018 |
| Germany | €87,259 | €153,273 | €301,210 | €622,718 | €1,490,366 |
| European average | €63,073 | €111,809 | €237,039 | €522,804 | €1,410,682 |

On most projects in Poland, the charge is calculated either as a fixed fee (on 28% of projects as percentage of contract value, and on 25% as a lump sum) or are billed hourly (on 22% of projects) (ACE, 2022). In a fixed fee contract, the are two ways to increase the operating profit: negotiating a higher fee or increasing productivity. Under hourly billing, every hour worked is charged-out to the client at an agreed rate, and the operating profit is included in that rate. Often, there is a cap on the maximum fee that can be paid. 

Charge-out rates per employee type in selected European markets:

| Country | Principals | Architects | Technologists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Poland | €18 | €11 | €6 |
| Portugal | €46 | €34 | €25 |
| Germany | €90 | €75 | €60 |
| European average | €65 | €51 | €39 |

In either method, the compensation is not tied to the value created for the client, but to the efficiency of work and general market price. This makes value offerings built around quality and speed of design very hard and leads to the commodification of architectural services (Bernstein, 2018).

Labor costs dominate the expenses of a practice, as salaries and benefits can make up over 90% of all costs (Unger, 2018). As both revenue and labor costs increase proportionally with employment, scaling up the business generally maintains a consistent operating margin. Consequently, rising unit labor costs force firms to either raise service prices or accept reduced margins.

Moreover, the architectural services market is saturated with numerous small firms fiercely competing against each other. There are around 5,000 architectural practices in Poland and almost 80% of them are sole-proprietor firms (ACE, 2022). 

`add % of practices with 1, 2, 3-5 etc staff bar chart` 

| Country | Sole-proprietor | Partnership | Limited company | Public company | Other |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Poland | 78 | 5 | 14 | 0 | 2 |
| Portugal | 50 | 5 | 7 | 28 | 10 |
| Germany | 66 | 14 | 12 | 0 | 8 |
| European average | 66 | 7 | 18 | 3 | 5 |

Fierce competition creates downward pressure on prices, limiting firms' ability to pass rising costs onto clients. What is important, smaller firms have smaller revenue backlogs meaning that low operating margins pose an existential threat to their financial stability (Deltek, 2024). The key takeaway is that the financial stability of a small architectural firm relies on keeping the labor cost as low as possible.

As a result of Poland's economic development, the growth model of competing with cheap labor has become obsolete. Since 2016, median wages in the private sector have risen by 85.3%, far outpacing the cumulative inflation of 56.7%. With a positive economic outlook and a shrinking labor force, polish labor costs are likely to continue rising (Piątkowski, 2023).

The opportunity cost of being an architect rises with wages increasing in other sectors. This creates a twofold effect: salaried architects demand higher wages, and top professionals leave for other industries when these demands are not met. In fact, the robust growth of the construction market, combined with the effect of a low starting point, has led the architect median pay to outpace the national median.

Furthermore, running an architecture business carries significant risks. Architectural firms often find themselves in a weaker position during contract negotiations, they typically lack dedicated operations staff and depend on a wide array of consultants to complete their projects (Unger, 2018). Their services carry professional liability, which can lead to lawsuits years after a project was completed (Bernstein, 2018). 

A higher risk profile demands higher margins to shelter the business from liabilities, cash flow problems and financial downturns. In practice, the average operating margin in most architecture firms ranges from 10% and 25% (Deltek, 2024). What is more, as the competition limits firms' ability to raise prices, while the job market constrains their capacity to lower labor costs, the margins in polish architectural practices may be trending downward. Operating margins falling below the average return from the capital market questions the economic viability of small, independent architectural firms.

Current market trends consequently raise concerns over the future of architecture as a liberal profession (EESC, 2017). If they persist, the architectural services market in Poland will likely consolidate as only larger companies will be able to compete. In the United States, where a wave of mergers and acquisitions has already occurred, the consolidation led to improved cost management and operating margin gains (Deltek, 2024).

This may also lead to a growing vertical integration in the industry as real estate developers and general contractors may want to integrate a discounted architectural practice into their organisation. The alignment of interest between designers, developers and builders may actually lead to an increase in the quality of work and further encourage vertical integration (Bernstein, 2018).

### Call to action for the profession

Given the challenging market outlook, what kind of steps can a sole-proprietor architectural practice undertake to stay afloat? Its three main options are: increasing the scale, specialising or lowering labor costs.

By definition small firms cannot compete with the scale of operations by themselves. But they can form consortiums or cooperation networks to share resources and take on more and bigger projects without losing independence. In Poland, 34% of practices have a formal association with another practice, which hints at cooperation being a popular strategy (ACE, 2022).

In reality, collaboration can be challenging due to differences in management styles and architects' attachment to individual creativity. A recent public competition illustrates this difficulty. Eleven small architecture firms formed a collective to compete for a large museum project. However, the collaboration largely failed: the collective produced three competing proposals, two firms left the group, and one of these departing firms went on to win the competition individually. Only one collective proposal received recognition (Architektura & Biznes, 2022).

For a specialised practice operating in a profitable niche, there may be room for raising prices. Notable niches include the luxury market, industrial or health architecture, adaptive reuse, mass timber or zero-energy design, facades, architectural software.

The third approach is to lower labor costs. But how can this be achieved given the continuous upward pressure on wages? Other industries (e.g. law, accounting) offer examples of outsourcing parts of professional services to countries with lower labor costs. Typically, back-office jobs are moved to cheaper labor markets such as South- and Southeast Asia or Eastern Europe. However, for small architecture firms, this approach raises several concerns. Architectural regulations vary significantly between countries, which creates two main issues: the difficulty in finding foreign expertise familiar with local regulations and the increased effort required for quality control of outsourced work. These factors make the feasibility of outsourcing questionable for small architectural practices, despite its potential cost benefits.

A more feasible alternative involves relying on flexible work arrangements for some aspects of professional services. This approach has already gained traction in architectural visualisation, with an increasing number of firms opting to outsource project renderings rather than produce them in-house. Firms can potentially extend this strategy to more aspects of the design process, allowing them to pay only for the labor required. However, this solution may prove to be short-lived. Architectural freelancing does not operate in isolation, and as a result, the cost of these services will inevitably increase in tandem with overall economic growth. Consequently, while outsourcing to local freelancers may offer immediate benefits, it may not be sustainable as a long-term strategy for managing costs and maintaining competitiveness.

## Objectives

This thesis explores an alternative approach: transforming modern architectural practice from a labor-intensive to a capital-intensive business model. This strategy aims to utilise the low cost of capital and capitalise on the digital nature of architectural services. In essence, it involves minimising human labor in the design process through technology and automation. A labor-lean practice would operate with a minimal workforce, focusing on tasks that are either too complex or cost-prohibitive to automate or outsource.

To assess the potential of automation a list of processes in the design service of architectural practice is evaluated. Every firm, big or small, has to fill the three basic roles to operate (Unger, 2018):

1. Business development
2. Finance
3. Design

In a sole-proprietor firm, all three roles are often performed by the owner, while any additional hires work on parts of the design process. Therefore, to establish a lean practice, the strategy is to reduce the labor-intensity of design processes, eliminating the need for employment, and to automate or outsource back-office operations. This shift allows the principal to focus on value-creating and client-facing tasks.

### Automation potential assessment

To assess the high-level potential of automating or outsourcing business processes the ICE method is used. Each of the tasks is rated for impact, confidence and ease (1 - low,  2 - medium, 3 - high) and the ICE score is computed by multiplying the ratings. Tasks with ICE score lower than 5 are discarded, tasks with score lower than 10 are kept for detailed assessment, and the rest of tasks is deemed potentially fit for automation.

`justify impact, confidence and ease ratings`

In principle, business development tasks that are client-facing (such as proposals and presentations) should be performed personally, as professional conduct is integral part of firm’s relationship strategy. Nonetheless, those processes can still benefit from data-driven decision-making. 

| BD tasks | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE score | Automate? | Outsource? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reviewing RFPs | 2 | 1 | 2 | 4 | No | No |
| Writing proposals | 2 | 1 | 2 | 4 | No | No |
| Preparing presentations | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | No | No |
| Direct marketing | 1 | 1 | 3 | 3 | No | No |
| Indirect marketing | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | No | No |

Finance processes lay outside of the scope of this thesis. Accounting is straightforward to outsource, while management and coordination tasks can be very hard to automate. 

| Finance tasks | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE score | Automate? | Outsource? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contract management | ? | ? | ? | ? | No | No |
| Invoicing | ? | ? | ? | ? | No | No |
| Consultant coordination | ? | ? | ? | ? | No | No |
| Accounting | 3 | 3 | 3 | 27 | No | Yes |
| Timesheets | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| Human resources | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| Office management | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |

As for the design processes, automation faces significant challenges. Processes that deal with the client personally, such as envisioning or construction observation are unlikely to be automated. On the other hand, the architectural production has a potential for automation and outsourcing. Production phases from programming to construction documentation will be evaluated in detail.

The primary concern for automation is the bespoke nature of construction projects. Unlike manufacturing, architecture deals predominantly with one-off designs. This characteristic poses an obstacle for traditional automation methods, which excel at replacing repetitive tasks. Adapting automation to the diverse demands of architectural design presents a complex challenge that this thesis will address.

| Design tasks | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE score | Automate? | Outsource? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Envisioning | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | No | No |
| Programming | 2 | 2 | 3 | 12 | Yes | No |
| Test fits | 2 | 2 | 2 | 8 | Maybe | No |
| Scheduling | 2 | 2 | 2 | 8 | Maybe | No |
| Budgeting | 2 | 2 | 3 | 12 | Yes | No |
| Conceptual Design | 3 | 2 | 3 | 18 | Yes | No |
| Technical Design | 2 | 2 | 2 | 8 | Maybe | Maybe |
| Construction Documentation | 3 | 2 | 1 | 6 | Maybe | Maybe |
| Construction observation | 3 | 1 | 1 | 3 | No | No |

### Key objectives

To recap, the aim of the thesis is to establish a lean design process for sole-proprietor architectural practices by automating labor-intensive tasks. The key objective are to:

- evaluate the potential of automation for architectural production processes
- automate suitable processes using existing open-source and commercially available tools and only develop new tools when it is critical to bridge the workflow
- enable a sole architect to deliver a technically sufficient and aesthetically adequate design for a medium-sized project in budget and on schedule
- perform an economic evaluation of the workflow

### Scope

`subject to change`

For the application the scope will be limited to: 

- polish architectural market and regulatory framework
- residential new-built projects of medium-size (under 5,000 sqm GFA)
- simple, convex plots under 2500 sqm area, zoned for residential development in the local plans of the city of Gdańsk
- OR simple, convex plots under 2500 sqm area without a local plan
