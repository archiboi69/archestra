# Foreword

`jaki jest cel tego dyplomu dla mnie?`

I chose architecture to improve the built environment. To do this effectively, I need to run a viable architectural
business. This thesis explores strategies for creating a next-generation practice.

# Part I: Theory

## Aim

This thesis aims to establish a lean, sustainable business model for sole-proprietor architectural practices by
automating labor-intensive tasks. The goal is to enable these firms to improve service quality and remain competitive
on the evolving market.

### The business of architecture

Architecture firms are small and medium enterprises that provide professional architectural services. The core of these
services involves translating client needs and regulatory requirements into functional, aesthetic, and durable designs.
To deliver these services, a firm usually employs architects who collaborate to create design solutions (Scharphie,
2014).

Most practices have a simple business model that converts a fee agreed in the contract to time billed to the project,
with leftover sum forming the operating profit on net revenue (Bernstein, 2018). To ensure continued business and
manage risk, firms need to increase their output to take on larger and more numerous projects. To achieve it, they
typically hire more architects and boost their productivity through investments in design tools (Celiński, 2024). This
ties the revenue to employment and for a given productivity level, the more architects work for a firm the greater its
revenue (ACE, 2022).

Revenues per practice size in select European markets:
| Country | 1 staff | 2 staff | 3-5 staff | 6-10 staff | 11-30 staff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Poland | €25,256 | €33,128 | €208,145 | €144,394 | €387,454 |
| Portugal | €24,416 | €46,214 | €134,954 | €260,457 | €1,223,018 |
| Germany | €87,259 | €153,273 | €301,210 | €622,718 | €1,490,366 |
| European average | €63,073 | €111,809 | €237,039 | €522,804 | €1,410,682 |

In Poland, architectural fees are typically structured as either fixed fees or hourly billing. Fixed fees, which account
for 53% of projects, can be calculated as a percentage of contract value (28% of cases) or as a lump sum (25% of cases).
Hourly billing is used in 22% of projects. For fixed fee contracts, architects can increase their operating profit by
negotiating a higher fee or improving productivity to complete work more efficiently. With hourly billing, clients are
charged an agreed rate for each hour worked, with the operating profit built into this hourly rate. Often, a maximum fee
cap is set for hourly billing projects (ACE, 2022).

These fee structures predominantly tie compensation to time spent rather than value created for the client, making it
challenging to offer premium services based on quality or speed of design (Bernstein, 2018).

Charge-out rates per employee type in selected European markets:
| Country | Principals | Architects | Technologists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Poland | €18 | €11 | €6 |
| Portugal | €46 | €34 | €25 |
| Germany | €90 | €75 | €60 |
| European average | €65 | €51 | €39 |

Labor costs dominate the expenses of architectural practices, with salaries and benefits accounting for over 90% of 
total costs (Unger, 2018). Since both revenue and labor costs typically increase proportionally with employment, 
scaling up the business generally maintains a consistent operating margin. This means that when unit labor costs rise, 
firms are forced to either increase their service prices or accept reduced profit margins.

Furthermore, the architectural services market in Poland is highly saturated and competitive. There are approximately 
5,000 architectural practices in the country, with nearly 80% of these being sole-proprietor firms (ACE, 2022). This 
high concentration of small firms intensifies competition in the market.

`add % of practices with 1, 2, 3-5 etc staff bar chart` 

| Country | Sole-proprietor | Partnership | Limited company | Public company | Other |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Poland | 78 | 5 | 14 | 0 | 2 |
| Portugal | 50 | 5 | 7 | 28 | 10 |
| Germany | 66 | 14 | 12 | 0 | 8 |
| European average | 66 | 7 | 18 | 3 | 5 |

Fierce competition creates downward pressure on prices, limiting firms' ability to pass rising costs onto clients.
What makes it challenging for small firms is that they have smaller revenue backlogs, meaning that low operating margins
pose an existential threat to their financial stability (Deltek, 2024). Consequently, the financial stability of a small
architectural firm heavily depends on maintaining low labor costs.

As Poland's economy reaches advanced status, competing with cheap labor is no longer a viable growth model. Since 2016,
median wages in the private sector have increased by 85.3%, significantly outpacing the cumulative inflation of 56.7%.
Given the positive economic outlook and a shrinking labor force, Polish labor costs are likely to continue rising
(Piątkowski, 2023).

The rising wages in other sectors increase the opportunity cost of being an architect. This creates two effects:
salaried architects demand higher wages, and top professionals leave for other industries when these demands are not
met. Notably, due to the robust growth of the construction market and a low starting point, the median pay for
architects has outpaced the national median.

Running an architecture business also carries significant risks. Architectural firms often have a weaker position in
contract negotiations. They typically lack dedicated operations staff and depend on a wide array of consultants to
complete projects (Unger, 2018). Their services carry professional liability, which can lead to lawsuits years after
project completion (Bernstein, 2018).

A higher risk profile demands higher margins to shelter businesses from liabilities, cash flow problems, and financial
downturns. In practice, the average operating margin in most architecture firms ranges from 10% to 25% (Deltek, 2024).
Moreover, as competition limits firms' ability to raise prices, while the job market constrains their capacity to lower
labor costs, margins in Polish architectural practices may be trending downward. Operating margins falling below the
average return from the capital market question the economic viability of small, independent architectural firms.

Current market trends consequently raise concerns over the future of architecture as a liberal profession (EESC, 2017).
If these trends persist, the architectural services market in Poland will likely consolidate, as only larger companies
will be able to compete. In the United States, where a wave of mergers and acquisitions has already occurred, this
consolidation led to improved cost management and operating margin gains (Deltek, 2024).

This may also lead to growing vertical integration in the industry, as real estate developers and general contractors
may want to incorporate discounted architectural practices into their organizations. The alignment of interests between
designers, developers, and builders may actually lead to an increase in work quality and further encourage vertical
integration (Bernstein, 2018).

### Call to action for the profession

Given the challenging market outlook, that make charging more for services and reducing labor costs difficult, what
kind of steps can a sole-proprietor architectural practice undertake? The main options are: bring in more
business, specialize, expand services or improve technology and work processes.

By definition small firms cannot compete with the scale of operations by themselves. But they can form consortia to
share resources and take on more business without losing independence. In Poland, 34% of practices have a
formal association with another practice, which hints at cooperation being a popular strategy (ACE, 2022).

In reality, collaboration can be challenging due to differences in management styles and architects' attachment to
individual creativity. A recent public competition illustrates this difficulty. Eleven small architecture firms formed
a collective to compete for a large museum project. However, the collaboration largely failed: the collective produced
three competing proposals, two firms left the group, and one of these departing firms went on to win the competition
individually. Only one collective proposal received recognition (Architektura & Biznes, 2022).

Specialization offers another promising avenue for small architectural practices to enhance their market position 
and potentially increase their pricing power. By focusing on a specific niche, firms can develop deep expertise, 
differentiate themselves from competitors, and potentially command higher fees. This strategy allows small practices 
to compete effectively against larger firms by offering specialized knowledge and services that may be outside the 
scope of generalist practices.

Some notable niches that small architectural firms might consider include:

- Luxury residential: Catering to high-net-worth individuals with bespoke design services
- Industrial architecture: Designing specialized facilities for manufacturing, logistics, or research
- Healthcare architecture: Creating healing environments for hospitals, clinics, and medical offices
- Adaptive reuse: Repurposing existing buildings for new functions, often with historical preservation considerations
- Mass timber design: Specializing in sustainable wooden structures for various building types
- Zero-energy design: Focusing on ultra-efficient buildings that produce as much energy as they consume
- Facade engineering: Developing innovative building envelopes for improved performance and aesthetics
- Architectural software development: Creating tools to enhance the design and management processes


The third approach to improving profitability is reducing labor costs, which poses challenges due to continuous upward
pressure on wages. Outsourcing to countries with lower labor costs, a strategy employed in other industries like law
and accounting, may prove to be problematic for small architecture firms. Varying regulations between countries make it
difficult to find foreign expertise familiar with local requirements and increase quality control efforts. Flexible
work arrangements with local freelancers offer a temporary solution, allowing firms to pay only for required labor.
This approach has gained traction, especially in architectural visualization. However, as freelance costs will likely
increase with overall economic growth, it may not provide a sustainable long-term strategy for managing costs and
maintaining competitiveness.

These limitations of traditional cost-cutting methods point towards the need for a more radical approach to reducing
labor-intensity in architectural practices. Automation emerges as a promising alternative to address the challenges of
labor costs while potentially offering more sustainable and scalable benefits for small firms.


Expanding services offers a compelling strategy for small architectural firms to enhance their competitiveness in the
market. By broadening their service offerings, these firms can create additional value for clients, differentiate
themselves from competitors, and potentially increase their revenue streams. This approach allows small practices to
leverage their existing expertise while addressing a wider range of client needs throughout the building lifecycle.

Traditional architectural services typically include:
- Test fits and feasibility studies
- Schematic design
- Technical design
- Construction documentation
- Permitting assistance
- Construction observation

However, firms can significantly enhance their market position by offering additional services such as:

1. Pre-design services:
   - Envisioning and goal-setting workshops
   - Strategic planning (e.g., masterplanning, workplace strategy)
   - Programming and space requirement analysis
   - Site selection and evaluation
   - Preliminary budgeting and cost estimation
   - Project scheduling and timeline development

3. Post-design services:
   - Bidding and contractor selection assistance
   - Construction management
   - Interior design and fit-out services
   - Post-occupancy evaluation and continued programming
   - Facility maintenance planning
   - Renovation consulting

By offering these expanded services, small architectural firms can:
1. Increase client engagement and loyalty throughout the project lifecycle
2. Generate additional revenue streams beyond traditional design fees
3. Differentiate themselves in a competitive market

However, it is important to note that small firms may traditionally lack the capacity to offer such a wide range of
services due to limited human resources. This is where the potential of automation in reducing labor requirements for
core design tasks becomes crucial. By using technology and automation to streamline their design processes, small
firms can free up valuable resources. This newfound capacity can then be redirected towards developing and offering these
expanded services, allowing small architectural practices to compete more effectively.


## State-of-the-art

## Objectives

This thesis explores an alternative approach to run a sustainable architectural practice: transforming it from a
labor-intensive to a capital-intensive business model. This strategy aims to utilise the low cost of capital and
capitalise on the digital nature of architectural services. In essence, it involves minimising human labor in the design
process through technology and automation. A labor-lean practice would operate with a minimal workforce, focusing
on tasks that are either too complex or cost-prohibitive to automate or outsource.

To assess the potential of automation a list of services provided by architectural practice is evaluated. Every firm,
big or small, has to fill the three basic roles to operate (Unger, 2018):

1. Business development
2. Finance
3. Design

In a sole-proprietor firm, all three roles are often performed by the owner, while any additional hires work on parts
of the design process. Therefore, the strategy to establish a lean practice is to reduce the labor-intensity of the 
design process, eliminating the need for employment, and to automate or outsource non-client-facing operations. 
This shift allows the principal to focus on optimizing the financial structure, expanding the service offer, 
reaching new clients and building relationships with existing ones.

Business development and finance processes lay outside of the scope of this thesis and the following analysis will
focus on the design tasks.

### Automation potential assessment

To assess the high-level potential of automating or outsourcing the design processes, the ICE method is employed. This
project management technique helps establish a priority order for ideas, features, or tasks. The method involves
three key assessments:

1. Impact (I): How valuable is the task in terms of time, money, and client satisfaction?
   - 3: Required by law, contract, or crucial for building client relationships
   - 2: Upsell for client or improvement of internal processes
   - 1: Not billable to client or low-frequency internal task

2. Confidence (C): How strong is the evidence supporting the impact assessment?
   - 3: Required by law or a core part of the fee
   - 2: Good understanding of the process
   - 1: Based on assumptions

3. Ease (E): How easy is it to automate the task?
   - 3: Off-the-shelf software
   - 2: Custom tools and services required
   - 1: Personal, manual or otherwise not easily automated

For each process, these three factors are assessed on a scale of 1 (low) to 3 (high). The ICE score is then computed
by multiplying the three estimates: ICE Score = Impact × Confidence × Ease. Tasks with an ICE score lower than 5 are
discarded, while those scoring 5 or higher are kept for a detailed assessment.

In the following evaluation, the traditional architectural services are expanded to include additional pre-design
services. However, additional construction and occupancy services are omitted as they primarily deal with physical
processes and are therefore outside the scope of this thesis.

| Pre-design | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE score | Automate? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Envisioning | 3 | 1 | 1 | 3 | No |
| Strategic planning | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | No |
| Programming | 2 | 1 | 3 | <u>**6**</u> | Maybe |
| Site selection | 2 | 1 | 3 | <u>**6**</u> | Maybe |
| Test fits | 2 | 1 | 3 | <u>**6**</u> | Maybe |

| Design | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE score | Automate? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Schematic design | 3 | 1 | 3 | <u>**9**</u> | Maybe |
| Technical design | 3 | 2 | 2 | <u>**12**</u> | Yes |
| Permitting | 3 | 3 | 2 | <u>**18**</u> | Yes |
| Construction<br> documentation | 3 | 1 | 2 | <u>**6**</u> | Maybe |
| Budgeting | 2 | 1 | 3 | <u>**6**</u> | Maybe |
| Scheduling | 2 | 1 | 2 | 4 | No |
| Consultant<br> coordination | 2 | 2 | 1 | 4 | No |

Automation in architectural design may significantly reduce the cost of redoing work and enable an iterative workflow.
Computational efficiency allows for exploration and refinement of design concepts, leading to better-optimized designs
and enhanced client satisfaction through more responsive design development. 

On the other hand, it faces significant challenges. The primary concern is the bespoke nature of construction projects.
Unlike manufacturing, architecture deals predominantly with one-off designs. This characteristic poses an obstacle for
traditional automation methods, which excel at replacing repetitive tasks. 

Adapting automation to the diverse demands
of architectural design presents a complex challenge that this thesis will address. Following initial assessment, the
scope will be limited to the pre-design (programming, site selection, test fits) and design (schematic, technical,
permitting) phases. Additionally, iterative budgeting will be included in the scope, starting from the first step of the
workflow.

### Key objectives

To recap, the aim of the thesis is to establish a lean design process for sole-proprietor architectural practices by
automating labor-intensive tasks. The key objective are to:

- evaluate the potential of automation of a worfklow from programming to permitting
- enable product iteration within and across phases
- automate suitable processes using existing open-source and commercially available tools and develop new tools
when it is critical to bridge the workflow
- enable a sole architect to deliver a technically sufficient and aesthetically adequate design for a medium-sized
project
- perform an economic evaluation of the workflow

### Scope

`subject to change`

For the application the scope will be limited to: 

- polish architectural market and regulatory framework
- residential new-built projects of medium-size (under 10,000 sqm GFA)
- simple, regular plots under 5,000 sqm area without a local plan
