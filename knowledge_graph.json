{"type":"entity","name":"BBSR, 2009","entityType":"Research","observations":["Building groups enable families to live affordably in inner-city areas, creating supportive neighborhoods and helping reduce out-migration from cities to surrounding areas","Baugruppen history: Started as individual 'exotic' projects in 1970s with friends developing properties together. Mid-1990s saw first large-scale emergence in Tübingen and Freiburg's conversion areas. Tübingen's city office coordinated groups in Südstadt development, while Freiburg's groups self-organized with architect support in Vauban and Rieselfeld. Initially faced skepticism from banks and authorities, but success in these cities helped move baugruppen from 'exotic niche' to mainstream, with thousands of units built across Germany","Professional consulting offices emerged to support baugruppen independently of architectural services, accompanying groups through the entire process until move-in, accumulating significant experience","Building groups can successfully develop areas and properties that traditional developers would not accept, demonstrating a price advantage over traditional developer projects","Building group motivations: Members primarily seek affordable property in central urban locations through collective action. While they would pursue property ownership independently if possible, the group approach enables them to access desirable inner-city locations otherwise unattainable due to plot size/price constraints. The model allows for significant input in design during planning phase, offering more influence than typical developer projects (beyond just selecting finishes). The ultimate goal is achieving individual ownership in preferred locations at moderate prices through co-determination and personal contributions","Professional supervision key to success: With expert architects and supervisors, building groups take 6-9 months from first meeting to construction start, versus 5-7 years without professional support. Architects ensure individual planning participation and location-appropriate construction, while building group supervisors use process expertise to expedite implementation, allowing members to focus on living space design and community building. Process follows phases: Community of interest → Planning community → Building community → Community of owners","New variant emerged: 'Architect building communities' where architects proactively acquire land plots (or options) and seek to form building communities around their ideas, as demonstrated by projects in Berlin's Rummelsburger Bucht","Building groups prioritize transferring single-family home qualities (privacy, functionality, child safety) to multi-story buildings, aspects often neglected by profit-oriented developers. While developers only consider user needs in competitive markets, building groups as end-users focus on highest possible living quality including urban planning, user-friendly floor plans, high-quality materials, and ecological aspects. Groups achieve 10-30% lower prices by avoiding developer costs (pre-financing, risk protection, interim acquisition, marketing) and through collective negotiation power for loans and materials","Building groups invest more time in planning, working directly with architects/consultants to find solutions for family needs. Their projects show stronger orientation towards demand and quality than developer projects, contributing to sustainable housing markets. Groups of families in similar life phases can design spaces (private to public transitions) that enable mutual assistance, with early planning phase creating lasting neighborhood bonds. Building groups often accept and improve challenging locations rejected by others, creating high-quality developments in areas traditional market would avoid. They have stabilizing effect on neighborhoods through long-term investment, community initiatives (childcare, clubs, cafes), and commitment to child-friendly environments","Municipal land ownership enables specific support strategies like reserving land contingents for building groups (as demonstrated in Tübingen). Effective plot reservation system involves six-month periods with extension options based on meeting defined interim goals","Successful municipal support includes providing infrastructure (meeting rooms), dedicated contact persons, and promotion of professional advisory structures through lectures and information materials. Cities can maximize building group opportunities through comprehensive public relations (brochures, information events, project exchanges, guidelines, coordinated press work, unified branding). Support ranges from minimal (single contact point) to comprehensive (dedicated department), with examples in Hamburg and Leipzig (separate agencies) versus Dresden (integration into existing departments)","Successful projects demonstrate effectiveness of external professional services. Early payment for architect and consultant services is crucial - not only for professionals' compensation but also demonstrates participant commitment and significantly improves group process efficiency, as shown in construction group K20"]}
